###### The primary difference between a view and a materialized view lies in how they store and manage data:

### View:
- **Definition**: A view is a virtual table that is based on the result set of a SQL query. It does not store data physically; instead, it retrieves data from the underlying tables each time it is accessed.
- **Data Storage**: No physical storage. The data is fetched from the base tables whenever the view is queried.
- **Performance**: Generally slower than materialized views for large datasets, as it always executes the query against the base tables.
- **Usage**: Suitable for scenarios where the underlying data changes frequently, and the latest data is always required.
- **Maintenance**: Requires no maintenance as it dynamically retrieves data from the base tables.

### Materialized View:
- **Definition**: A materialized view is a database object that contains the results of a query and stores them physically. It is periodically refreshed to keep the data up-to-date.
- **Data Storage**: Physical storage. The result set of the query is stored in the database.
- **Performance**: Generally faster for read operations since the data is precomputed and stored, reducing the need to query the base tables each time.
- **Usage**: Suitable for scenarios where quick read access is needed, and the data does not change frequently. It is useful for reporting and analytical queries.
- **Maintenance**: Requires maintenance to keep the data up-to-date. This is typically done through scheduled refreshes.

### Summary:
- **View**: No physical storage, always retrieves data from base tables, slower for large datasets, requires no maintenance.
- **Materialized View**: Stores data physically, faster for read operations, requires periodic refreshes to maintain data accuracy.
