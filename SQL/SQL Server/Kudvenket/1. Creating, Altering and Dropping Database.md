#### Get the list of tables exist in the database
```sql
SELECT      table_name, table_schema, table_type
FROM        infortmation_schema.tables
ORDER BY    table_name ASC;
```

#### Drop a database
```sql
DROP DATABASE <db-name>;
```
> When you drop a database both the MDF and LDF files will be deleted.
> Make sure the database not is use while deleting
> 
> You cannot drop a database, if it is currently in use. 

#### Alter with Rollback Immediate
```sql
ALTER DATABASE <db-name> Set SINGLE_USER With Rollback Immediate;
```

> Consider a scenario where 1 user is trying to delete a database and another user is doing a transaction since, user1 cannot perform the delete operation because db is in used, but user1 is setting the database in Single_User_mode so we have to use the "WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE" i.e., if user2 was perform any transactions in the database those must be rollbacked.
> 
> or
> 
> With Rollback Immediate option, will rollback all incomplete transactions and closes the connection to the database.
