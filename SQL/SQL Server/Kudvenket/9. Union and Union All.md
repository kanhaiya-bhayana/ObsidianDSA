In SQL Server, `UNION` and `UNION ALL` are used to combine the result sets of two or more `SELECT` queries. However, they differ in how they handle duplicate rows.

### UNION
- **Functionality**: Combines the result sets of two or more `SELECT` queries and removes duplicate rows.
- **Syntax**:
    ```sql
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table1
    UNION
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table2;
    ```
- **Use Case**: Use `UNION` when you want a distinct list of results from the combined queries.

### UNION ALL
- **Functionality**: Combines the result sets of two or more `SELECT` queries without removing duplicate rows.
- **Syntax**:
    ```sql
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table1
    UNION ALL
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table2;
    ```
- **Use Case**: Use `UNION ALL` when you want all rows from the combined queries, including duplicates. This is typically faster than `UNION` because it does not require the additional step of removing duplicates.

### Key Differences
1. **Duplicates**:
   - `UNION`: Removes duplicate rows from the result set.
   - `UNION ALL`: Includes all rows, even duplicates, in the result set.

2. **Performance**:
   - `UNION`: Slower, due to the need to sort and remove duplicates.
   - `UNION ALL`: Faster, as it does not perform the additional sorting and duplicate removal step.

### Example
Assume we have two tables, `table1` and `table2`, with the following data:

`table1`:
| id | name  |
|----|-------|
| 1  | Alice |
| 2  | Bob   |

`table2`:
| id | name   |
|----|--------|
| 2  | Bob    |
| 3  | Charlie|

#### Using UNION
```sql
SELECT id, name
FROM table1
UNION
SELECT id, name
FROM table2;
```
Result:
| id | name   |
|----|--------|
| 1  | Alice  |
| 2  | Bob    |
| 3  | Charlie|

#### Using UNION ALL
```sql
SELECT id, name
FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT id, name
FROM table2;
```
Result:
| id | name   |
|----|--------|
| 1  | Alice  |
| 2  | Bob    |
| 2  | Bob    |
| 3  | Charlie|

### Practical Considerations
- **When to use UNION**: Use `UNION` when you need to ensure the combined result set is unique and you can tolerate the potential performance hit from removing duplicates.
- **When to use UNION ALL**: Use `UNION ALL` when performance is critical and duplicate rows are acceptable or when you know the result sets are already distinct.

Understanding these differences helps in optimizing queries for performance and ensuring the correct results are returned based on the requirements.

#### Sorting results of a UNION or UNION ALL
ORDER BY clause should be used only on the last SELECT statement in the UNION query   



#### Difference between UNION and JOIN
UNION combines the result-set of two or more select queries into a single result-set which includes all the rows from all the queries in the union, where as JOINS, retrieve data from two or more tables based on logical relationships b/w the tables.

> In short, UNION combines rows from 2 or more tables, where JOINS combine columns from 2 or more table.
