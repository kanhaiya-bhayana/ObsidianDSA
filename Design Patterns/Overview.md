### Design Patterns are common architectural approaches.
 
 ###### Design Patterns are typically split into three categories and that is called Gamma Categorization

1. Creational
2. Structural
3. Behavioral 
## Creational

- Builder
- Factories
	- Abstract Factory
	- Factory Method
- Prototype
- Singleton

1. Deal with creation (construction) of objects.
2. Explicit (constructor) vs. implicit (DI, reflection, etc.)

## Structural

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

1. Concerned with the structure (e.g., class members)
2. Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class interface
3. Stress the importance of good API design

## Behavioral

- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Interpreter
- Mediator
- Memento
- Null Object
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor

1. They are all different; no central theme
