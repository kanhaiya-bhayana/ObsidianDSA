> [Connected component](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/) in an undirected graph refers to a group of vertices that are connected to each other through edges, but not connected to other vertices outside the group.

For example in the graph shown below, {0, 1, 2} form a connected component and {3, 4} form another connected component.

Example of connected components

### Characteristics of Connected Component:

- A connected component is a set of vertices in a graph that are connected to each other.
- A graph can have multiple connected components.
- Inside a component, each vertex is reachable from every other vertex in that component.

### How to identify  Connected Component:

There are several algorithms to identify Connected Components in a graph. The most popular ones are:

- [Depth-First Search (DFS)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/depth-first-search-or-dfs-for-a-graph/)
- [Breadth-First Search (BFS)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/breadth-first-search-or-bfs-for-a-graph/)
- [Union-Find Algorithm (also known as Disjoint Set Union)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-disjoint-set-data-structure-or-union-find-algorithm/)

### Applications of  Connected Component:

- [Graph Theory:](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-theory-tutorial/) It is used to find subgraphs or clusters of nodes that are connected to each other.
- [Computer Networks:](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basics-computer-networking/) It is used to discover clusters of nodes or devices that are linked and have similar qualities, such as bandwidth.
- [Image Processing:](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/digital-image-processing-basics/) Connected components also have usage in image processing.
