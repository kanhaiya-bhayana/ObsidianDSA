> Transpilation to JavaScript: TypeScript code is transpiled into JavaScript **for browser interpretation**, enabling browsers to read and display the code.
---
TypeScript is converted to JavaScript because TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that introduces static types and other features to help developers write more robust and maintainable code. However, browsers and most JavaScript environments (such as Node.js) only understand and execute JavaScript. Therefore, TypeScript code needs to be transpiled (converted) to JavaScript so that it can run in these environments. Here are some key reasons for this conversion process:

1. **Compatibility**: JavaScript is the standard language for web development, and all browsers and JavaScript engines are built to understand and execute JavaScript code. By converting TypeScript to JavaScript, TypeScript code can run anywhere JavaScript runs.

2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript adds static type checking to JavaScript, which helps catch errors at compile time rather than at runtime. This improves the reliability of the code but requires a transpilation step to strip out the type information for execution.

3. **Advanced Features**: TypeScript introduces features such as interfaces, enums, and more advanced ES6+ features that may not be fully supported in all JavaScript environments. The TypeScript compiler ensures that these features are transpiled to compatible JavaScript code.

4. **Tooling and Development Experience**: TypeScript provides a better development experience with features like type annotations, interfaces, and better tooling support (e.g., IntelliSense, code refactoring). These features are designed to help developers write better code but are not needed in the final runtime code.

5. **Backward Compatibility**: TypeScript can target different versions of JavaScript (ES3, ES5, ES6, etc.), allowing developers to write code using modern features and still support older environments.

The TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) handles this transpilation process, converting TypeScript code into clean, readable, and standard JavaScript code that can be executed by JavaScript engines.

###### Summary
TypeScript is converted to JavaScript to ensure compatibility with browsers and JavaScript engines while providing type safety and advanced features during development.

###### Build folder
- Have the compiled code
- css
- js


###### Do not create .js file if there is an error inside the .ts file

Uncomment the below line of code in the tsConfig.json file

```ts
"noEmitOnError": true,                            /* Disable emitting files if any type checking errors are reported. */
```

or you may override the behavior of this by using the below flag | command line argument
```sh
$ tsc --noEmitOnError -w
```
this will override the behavior of the tsConfig.json file
