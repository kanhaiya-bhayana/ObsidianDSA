It is always a good practice to go for the CMS, so that I can involve my team and their efforts in more creative development work, rather than spending my precious intellectual resource on formatting and editing content of a website.


#### Why

A **CMS** simplifies website creation and management, enabling users to update content, customize designs, and scale functionality without coding expertise. It saves time, reduces costs, and supports collaboration, making it ideal for businesses and individuals alike.
##### What
A content management system (CMS) is software that helps users create, manage, and modify content on a website without the need for technical knowledge. In other words, a CMS lets you build a website without needing to write code from scratch (or even know how to code at all).

### What makes up a content management system?[](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/content-management-system/#what-makes-up-a-content-management-system)

On a more technical level, a content management system is made up of two core parts:

- **A content management application (CMA)** – this is the part that allows you to actually add and manage content on your site (like you saw above).
- **A content delivery application (CDA)** – this is the backend, behind-the-scenes process that takes the content you input in the CMA, stores it properly, and makes it visible to your visitors.

Together, the two systems make it easy to maintain your website.





### **Why Use a CMS?**

A **Content Management System (CMS)** simplifies website management, making it accessible to individuals and businesses without extensive technical skills. Here's why it's essential:

1. **Ease of Use**: No coding knowledge is needed to create, edit, or manage content.
2. **Cost-Effective**: Reduces reliance on developers for regular updates.
3. **Scalability**: Grows with your business through plugins and extensions.
4. **Efficiency**: Streamlines workflows with tools for collaboration, scheduling, and publishing.
5. **Customizability**: Offers themes and plugins for design and functionality tailored to your needs.
6. **SEO-Friendly**: Many CMS platforms have built-in or add-on tools to enhance search visibility.
