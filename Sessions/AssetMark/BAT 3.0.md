#### What is micro-frontend?

A **micro-frontend** is an architectural style for frontend development that breaks down a web application into smaller, loosely coupled, and independently deployable fragments, or "micro-frontends." 

Inspired by the principles of microservices in backend development, this approach allows individual teams to develop, test, and deploy each part of a frontend application independently.
