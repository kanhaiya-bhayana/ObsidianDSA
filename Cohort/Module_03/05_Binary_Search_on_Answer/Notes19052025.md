## Q1. Painters Partition
### Given an array of size N, where A[i] represents the length of the ith board. Given an integer K representing the number of painters available.

>💡It takes 1 painter 1 unit to time to paint 1 unit of length
### Calculate the minimum amount of time required to paint all boards ❔

```
Constraints:
1. Two painters cannot share the board
2. A painter will only paint continuous boards i.e., (subarray of boards)
```
#### Solution 🙂

> ❌  Add the length of all boards and divide by k this will not work ❌ 

##### Answer Space
```
Min. value of min time = Max length of board
Max. value of min time = Sum of length of all boards
```
##### Code 💻
```java
public int minTime(int[] arr, int n, int k){
	int s = maxEleofArray(arr);
	int e = sumOfAllArrayElements(arr);
	
	while (s <= e){
		int mid = s + (e-s)/2;
		if (check(A,n,mid,k)){
			if (mid == 0 || check(A,n,mid-1,k)){
				return mid;
			}
			else{
				e = mid -1;
			}
		}
		else{
			s = mid + 1;
		}
	}
}

private boolean check(int [] arr, int n, int time, int k){
	int cnt = 0;
	int sum = 0;
	
	for (int i=0; i<n; i++){
		sum += arr[i];
		if (sum > time){
			cnt++;
			sum = arr[i];
			if (cnt > k){
				break;
			}
		}
		
	}
	
	return (cnt <= k);
}
```

## Q2. Aggressive Cows
### You purchase N cows to setup a farm (All the cows are very aggressive). You have built M stalls to tie these N cows(M > N)

>Given the location of M stalls along x-axis. Find the max value of min. distance b/w any tow cows.

```
Note:
1. There can only be 1 cow in 1 stall
2. We have to place alll cows
```
#### What is the objective of the problem described?
Place cows in stalls such that the minimum distance between any two cows is maximized.

#### 🙂Answer Space

>Min value of  min dist. b/w 2 cows = 1
>Max value of min dist. b/w 2 cows = arr[M-1] - arr[0]
