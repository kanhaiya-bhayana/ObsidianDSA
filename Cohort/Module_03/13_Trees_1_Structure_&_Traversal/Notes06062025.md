## What is a Tree?

#### What is a depth of a Tree?
> Level at which the node is present (Distance from root node)
#### Height of a Node
>The length of the longest path from the node to the farthest leaf node. 
#### Ancestors
>All nodes in the path from current node to root node (including current node)
#### Descendant
> Any successor node on the path from the leaf node to that node (including current node)

## Nomenclature
### Tree Nomenclature Based on Maximum Number of Child Nodes

| Max No. of Child Nodes | Name         |
|------------------------|--------------|
| 2                      | Binary Tree  |
| 3                      | Ternary Tree |
| 4                      | Quad Tree    |
| ...                    | ...          |
| N                      | N-ary Tree   |

## Binary Tree & Types
### Binary Tree
> Max of 2 children nodes --> {0,1,2}
#### Types of Binary Tree
##### 1. Proper Binary Tree
- Every node has 0 or 2 children
##### 2. Perfect Binary Tree
- All levels are completely filed.
- All nodes have exactly two children except last level(0 child).
##### 3. Complete Binary Tree
- All levels are completely filed except last level.
- Last level is filled from left to right.


>Perfect tree is also a complete binary tree, and Proper binary tree.

## Structure of a Tree

```java
class TreeNode{
	int data;
	TreeNode left;
	TreeNode right;
	TreeNode(){}
	TreeNode (int x){ data = x; }
	TreeNode (int x, TreeNode l, TreeNode r){
		data = x;
		left = l;
		right = r;
	}
}
```

##### TC of all the traversals are
>O(n)
##### SC of all the traversals are
>O(h) --> height of the recursive tree (i.e.,) in worst case = O(n)
