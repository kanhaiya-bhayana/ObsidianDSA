## 1. Introduction

### Recursion
> Function calling itself
> Solving a problem using the solution of smaller instances of the same problem.
#### Example: Calculate the sum of first n natural numbers

```
Sum(N) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 ...................+(N-2) + (N-1) + N
Sum(N) = Sum(N-1) + N
```

### Steps to Write Recursive Code
1. **Assumption:** Decide what the recursive function does for the given problem
2. **Main Logic:** How to solve problem using its subproblem
3. **Base Case:** Identify where to stop the recursion


### Function Call Tracing
>Tracing a sequence of function calls that are made when a program is executed.


### Q. Given a positive integer N.

#### #Fibonacci
# Fibonacci  
```java
public int fib(int n){
	
	// base case
	if (n == 0 || n == 1){
		return n;
	}
	
	return fib (n-1) + fib(n-2);
}
```

The given code implements a **recursive solution** to compute the Fibonacci number at position n. Here's an analysis of its **time complexity** and **space complexity**:

#### **Time Complexity**

1. **Recursive Calls**:
    
    - Each call to `fib(n)` makes **two recursive calls**: `fib(n-1)` and `fib(n-2)`.
        
    - The recursion tree grows exponentially because the function does not reuse computed results (e.g., `fib(n-2)` is recomputed for both `fib(n-1)` and `fib(n)`).
        
2. **Size of Recursion Tree**:
    
    - The recursion tree has a height of n, and the number of calls approximately doubles at each level.
        
    - Total number of calls is proportional to 2n2^n.
        
    
    Therefore, the **time complexity** is:
    
    O(2n)O(2^n)

#### **Space Complexity**

1. **Call Stack**:
    
    - At any given point, the maximum depth of recursive calls is nn, which corresponds to the height of the recursion tree.
        
    - The function does not use any additional space apart from the recursion stack.
        
    
    Therefore, the **space complexity** is:
    
    O(n)O(n)

---

#### Summary

- **Time Complexity**: O(2n)O(2^n)
    
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)O(n)
    

#### Optimization Insight

This implementation is highly inefficient due to repeated computations of the same subproblems. A better approach is to use **memoization** or **dynamic programming**, which reduces the time complexity to O(n)O(n) while maintaining a space complexity of O(n)O(n) (or O(1)O(1) with an iterative approach).
