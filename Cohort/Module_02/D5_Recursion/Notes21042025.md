## 1. Introduction

### Recursion
> Function calling itself
> Solving a problem using the solution of smaller instances of the same problem.
#### Example: Calculate the sum of first n natural numbers

```
Sum(N) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 ...................+(N-2) + (N-1) + N
Sum(N) = Sum(N-1) + N
```

### Steps to Write Recursive Code
1. **Assumption:** Decide what the recursive function does for the given problem
2. **Main Logic:** How to solve problem using its subproblem
3. **Base Case:** Identify where to stop the recursion


### Function Call Tracing
>Tracing a sequence of function calls that are made when a program is executed.


### Q. Given a positive integer N.
