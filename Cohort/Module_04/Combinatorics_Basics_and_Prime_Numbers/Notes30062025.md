## 1. Permutation

- Arrangement of objects
- In permutation, order matters `(i,j) != (j,i)`

#### Given 3 distinct characters. No. of ways we can arrange them to form a string of length 3.
> Soln. n! `=` 3! `=` 6


#### Given N distinct elements. In how many ways can you arrange R out of N elements?
>Soln. `n!` / `(n-r)!` = `nPr`

`arrange means permutation`

---
## 2. Combination

- No. of ways to select something
- In combination, order does not matters `(i,j) = (j,i)`

`selection means Combination`
#### Given 4 players. Find the no. of ways to select 3 players out of 4?
> Soln. `n!` / `r!(n-r)!` = `nCr`

### Properties of Combination
1. No. of ways of selecting 0 out of N element?
	1.`nC0 (where r = 0)` = 1
   2.  Ways to select R out of N elements `nCn` = 1
   3. Ways to select (n-r) out of N elements `nCr` = `nC(n-r)`
   4. Selecting R out of N elements `nCr` = `n-1Cr-1` + `n-1Cr`
