In C#, the principles for designing a system to handle real-time streaming data with scalability and fault tolerance are quite similar to those in Java, but the tools and libraries may differ. Here's how you can design a real-time streaming system in C#:

### 1. **Stream Ingestion**
To handle stream ingestion, you can use message queuing and event streaming systems.

- **Apache Kafka** with Confluent .NET Client: 
   - Kafka is still one of the most popular choices for real-time streaming, and Confluent provides an official .NET client (`Confluent.Kafka`) to integrate Kafka with C#. Kafka's strong point is its scalability and fault tolerance, and it supports high throughput by distributing data across partitions and brokers.
   - Kafka allows consumers to scale horizontally and handle high message volumes by partitioning the data, and it offers **replication** for fault tolerance.

- **Azure Service Bus / Event Hubs**:
   - If you're in a Microsoft Azure environment, you can use **Azure Event Hubs** for ingesting large volumes of real-time data. It is designed for high-throughput, low-latency event streaming, and it integrates seamlessly with C#.
   - **Azure Service Bus** can also be used if you're handling more traditional messaging patterns, though Event Hubs is more suited for high-volume, real-time data streaming.

- **RabbitMQ**:
   - Another option is **RabbitMQ** for message queuing. While RabbitMQ is less high-throughput than Kafka or Event Hubs, it can still be a good option for many real-time systems, especially in scenarios where reliability and fault tolerance are critical.
   - It provides support for clustering and replication to improve fault tolerance.

### 2. **Stream Processing**
Once the data is ingested, you need to process it in real-time.

- **Stream Processing Libraries**: 
   - **Streamiz.Kafka.Net**: This is a .NET-based Kafka Streams library. It allows you to process Kafka data in a stream processing pipeline similar to how Kafka Streams works in Java. It supports operations like aggregations, joins, and transformations in a distributed and fault-tolerant manner.
   
- **Azure Stream Analytics**:
   - If you’re leveraging Azure services, **Azure Stream Analytics** can provide a fully managed service to process real-time streaming data. You can use SQL-like queries to process and transform the data, and the service offers seamless integration with other Azure services like Event Hubs and Azure Functions.
   
- **Apache Flink (via .NET bindings)**:
   - Though Apache Flink has official Java and Scala support, there are some community-supported .NET bindings to work with Flink. Flink is a powerful tool for stream processing and supports fault tolerance through checkpoints and stateful processing.

- **Reactive Extensions (Rx.NET)**:
   - For simpler use cases, you could use **Reactive Extensions (Rx.NET)** for building asynchronous event-driven systems. While it’s not as powerful as Kafka Streams or Flink for large-scale data processing, it’s an excellent tool for handling data streams within a .NET application.

### 3. **Fault Tolerance and Scalability**
Fault tolerance and scalability are essential to ensure the system stays operational under load and can recover gracefully from failures.

- **Message Broker Replication**:
   - Both **Kafka** and **Azure Event Hubs** provide message replication and partitioning. Kafka’s replication factor can be configured for fault tolerance, ensuring that if a broker fails, the data is still available from another replica.
   - In **Azure Event Hubs**, data is partitioned across different brokers, and the system ensures high availability by maintaining multiple copies of the data in different availability zones.

- **Stateful Stream Processing**:
   - **Kafka Streams** (via Streamiz.Kafka.Net in C#) or **Azure Stream Analytics** allow you to maintain state while processing data. These tools can checkpoint intermediate state, so even if a process fails, it can resume from the last consistent state.
   - For stateful operations in Kafka Streams, each partition’s state is stored in local rocksDB instances, ensuring low-latency stateful operations.

- **Distributed Systems & Auto-Scaling**:
   - Leverage **Kubernetes** or **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** for scaling your stream processing services. Kubernetes can auto-scale your consumer instances based on load and ensures that your services can scale horizontally in response to increased demand.
   - **Azure Functions** can also auto-scale based on the number of events coming from Event Hubs or Service Bus.

- **Consumer Groups**:
   - In Kafka, consumers are grouped into **consumer groups**, which ensures that multiple consumers can work in parallel to process different partitions of the data, providing scalability.

### 4. **Error Handling and Reliability**
For fault tolerance and reliability:

- **Retry Logic and Dead-letter Queues**:
   - Implement **retry policies** for transient errors in your C# application (for instance, using **Polly**, a .NET resilience and transient-fault-handling library).
   - Set up **dead-letter queues** for messages that can’t be processed (e.g., malformed messages or data that can’t be processed due to downstream system failures).

- **Exactly Once Semantics (EOS)**:
   - In Kafka, you can configure **exactly-once semantics** (EOS), ensuring that each message is processed exactly once even in the event of failures. With Kafka, you can enable EOS on both the producer and consumer sides.

### 5. **Monitoring and Logging**
Monitoring your real-time data pipeline is crucial to detect issues early and ensure smooth operation.

- **Prometheus & Grafana**:
   - **Prometheus** (for collecting metrics) and **Grafana** (for visualizing the data) are popular open-source tools for monitoring. You can export Kafka metrics and stream processing metrics to Prometheus and set up alerts in Grafana.

- **Azure Monitor**:
   - If you're working in Azure, **Azure Monitor** and **Application Insights** can provide built-in monitoring and logging for your Event Hubs, Azure Functions, and other Azure-based components.

- **Kafka Manager / Confluent Control Center**:
   - **Kafka Manager** (or **Confluent Control Center** for Confluent Kafka) helps you manage and monitor your Kafka cluster, including checking the health of brokers, consumer groups, and topics.

### 6. **Data Storage**
For storing processed data, you can use various databases or storage systems, depending on your use case.

- **NoSQL Databases**:
   - Use databases like **Cassandra**, **Azure Cosmos DB**, or **MongoDB** for real-time ingestion and low-latency queries.

- **Time-Series Databases**:
   - If you are processing time-series data, you can use databases like **InfluxDB** or **Azure Time Series Insights**.

- **Data Lakes**:
   - Use a **data lake** (such as **Azure Data Lake Storage**) if you need to store raw streaming data in a cost-effective way for further analysis or processing.

- **SQL Databases**:
   - For traditional transactional data, you can store processed results in **SQL Server** or **Azure SQL Database**.

### 7. **Microservices and Event-Driven Architecture**
- If your system is built around microservices, you can use **Azure Service Bus** or **Kafka** for communication between services.
- **Azure Functions** can be used for serverless processing of events coming from Event Hubs or Service Bus, allowing for scalable, event-driven workflows.

### Final System Architecture Overview
Here’s a sample architecture for a real-time streaming system using C#:
1. **Ingestion**: Kafka (via `Confluent.Kafka`) or Azure Event Hubs for real-time event ingestion.
2. **Processing**: Stream processing via `Streamiz.Kafka.Net`, Azure Stream Analytics, or a custom solution using Rx.NET.
3. **Storage**: NoSQL (e.g., Cosmos DB), time-series databases (InfluxDB), or data lakes (Azure Data Lake).
4. **Fault Tolerance**: Use message replication in Kafka or Event Hubs, and ensure retries, dead-letter queues, and checkpoints.
5. **Microservices**: Event-driven microservices using Azure Functions or custom C# microservices.
6. **Scaling**: Auto-scaling with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Kubernetes.
7. **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana or Azure Monitor for monitoring.

### Conclusion
The design of a real-time streaming system in C# revolves around leveraging distributed streaming tools like Kafka or Azure Event Hubs, along with stream processing frameworks (like Streamiz.Kafka.Net or Azure Stream Analytics). Focus on fault tolerance through message replication, checkpointing, and stateful processing, while ensuring scalability through horizontal scaling and auto-scaling techniques. Additionally, ensure high availability, real-time monitoring, and proper error handling throughout the system.
