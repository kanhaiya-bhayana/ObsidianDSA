A stored procedure in SQL Server is a precompiled collection of one or more SQL statements that are stored under a name and processed as a unit. Stored procedures can be used to encapsulate complex business logic and data manipulation tasks, making database operations more efficient and reusable. Here are some key features and benefits of stored procedures:

### Key Features

1. **Precompiled Execution**: Stored procedures are compiled and optimized when they are created, which can improve performance when they are executed multiple times.

2. **Reusability**: Stored procedures can be reused by multiple programs or users, which promotes code reuse and simplifies maintenance.

3. **Modularity**: Complex operations can be broken down into smaller, manageable pieces, improving code organization and readability.

4. **Security**: Stored procedures can help enhance security by restricting direct access to underlying tables and by providing a controlled interface for database operations. Permissions can be granted on the stored procedure level rather than on the underlying data.

5. **Parameterization**: Stored procedures can accept input parameters, allowing for dynamic execution and flexibility.

### Benefits

1. **Improved Performance**: Because stored procedures are precompiled, they can execute faster than equivalent ad-hoc queries.

2. **Reduced Network Traffic**: Stored procedures can reduce network traffic between an application and the database server by processing complex operations on the server side.

3. **Consistency**: Using stored procedures ensures that the same logic is applied consistently across different applications and users.

4. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes to business logic or data manipulation can be made in one place within the stored procedure, rather than in multiple application codes.

### Example

Here's a simple example of a stored procedure in SQL Server:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeDetails
    @EmployeeID INT
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT FirstName, LastName, Title, Department
    FROM Employees
    WHERE EmployeeID = @EmployeeID;
END;
```

To execute this stored procedure, you would use:

```sql
EXEC GetEmployeeDetails @EmployeeID = 1;
```

In this example, the stored procedure `GetEmployeeDetails` takes an `EmployeeID` as a parameter and returns the details of the specified employee.

> Note: When naming user defined stored procedures, Microsoft recommends not to use sp_ as a prefix. All system stored procedures, are prefixed with sp_. This avoids any ambiguity b/w user defined and system stored procedures and any conflicts, with some future system procedure.

## To execute the stored procedure

1. spName
2. EXEC spName
3. EXECUTE spName

> Note: You can also right click on the procedure name, in object explorer in SQL Server Management Studio and select EXECUTE STORED PROCEDURE.

###### To change the stored procedure, use ALTER PROCEDURE statement.
###### To delete the SP, use DROP PROC 'SPName' or DROP PROCEDURE 'SPName'
###### To encrypt the text of the SP, use WITH ENCRYPTION option. It is not possible to view the text of an encrypted SP.


## Advantages of stored procedures

1. Execution plan retention and reusability
2. Reduces network traffic
3. Code reusability and better maintainability
4. Better security
5. Avoid SQL Injection attack


### Create Stored Procedure with Parameters

```
Parameters and variables have an @ prefix in their name.

To Execute:
EXCEUTE  spName <param1>, <param2>
EXCEUTE  spName <@paramName1 = value>, <@paramName2 = value>

To View the text, of the stored procedure
1. Use system stored procedure sp_helptext 'SPName'
OR
2. Right click the SP in object explorer-> Scrip Procedure as-> Create To-> New Query Editor Window
 ```
