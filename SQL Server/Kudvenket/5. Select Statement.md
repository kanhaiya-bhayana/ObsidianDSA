#### Fully Qualified Name

```sql
SELECT    [column1], [column2].......,
FROM      [db-name].[dbo].[table-name]
GO;
```

>Advantage of having a fully qualified table-name is we can execute a query from any database context. In other words do not write the USE DATABASE db-name at the top level.
>
>By default Master database is selected.

#### Select Examples
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Name,GenderID FROM tblPerson; 

SELECT * FROM tblPerson WHERE GenderID <> 1; 

SELECT * FROM tblPerson WHERE GenderID IN(2,3,5); 
```

##### Select all the records whose name starts with any specific character 
```sql
SELECT * FROM tblPerson WHERE Name LIKE 'R%'; 
```
##### Email validation... which contains @ in the email 
```sql
SELECT * FROM tblPerson WHERE Email LIKE '%@%';
```
##### Fetch all the records where email contains 1 character before @ and one character after @ 
```sql
SELECT * FROM tblPerson WHERE Email LIKE '_@_.com';
```
##### Select the records where name starts with the Either M, S, or T 
```sql
SELECT * FROM tblPerson WHERE Name LIKE '[MST]%';
```

## Order by for sorting | default order is ascending

##### Select the details and sort them based on 2 columns, Name by DESC, Age by ASC
```sql
SELECT * FROM tblPerson ORDER BY Name DESC, Age ASC;
```

### Top Keyword

The `TOP` keyword in SQL Server is used to limit the number of rows returned by a query. It is particularly useful when you want to retrieve only a specific number of rows from a table, which can be helpful for pagination or when you need to get a subset of data.

##### Parameters

- `number`: The number of rows to return.
- `PERCENT` (optional): Indicates that the query should return the specified percentage of rows instead of an exact number.
- `column1, column2, ...`: The columns to retrieve.
- `table_name`: The table from which to retrieve the rows.
- `condition` (optional): A condition to filter rows.
- `ORDER BY`: Defines the order in which to return the rows. This is important when you want to ensure the returned rows are the top rows according to specific sorting criteria.

```sql
SELECT TOP (number) [PERCENT] column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
ORDER BY column_name [ASC|DESC];
```

```sql
SELECT TOP (10) *
FROM Employees
ORDER BY Salary DESC;
```

#### Select the record whose age is oldest
```sql
SELECT TOP 1 * FROM tblPerson ORDER BY Age DESC;
```

#### Select the employee with the Maximum salary
```sql
SELECT TOP 1 * FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary DESC;
```

> Using the `TOP` keyword effectively allows you to manage large datasets by focusing on the most relevant or highest priority rows, based on your specific criteria.
