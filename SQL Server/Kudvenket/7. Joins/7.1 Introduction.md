# Joins in SQL Server

- Joins in SQL Server are used to retrieve data from 2 or more related tables. 
- In general tables are related to each other using foreign key constraints.

## In SQL Server, there are different types of JOINS

1. INNER JOIN
2. OUTER JOIN 
3. CROSS JOIN

## Outer Joins are again divided into

1. Left Join or Left Outer Join
2. Right Join or Right Outer Join
3. Full Join or Full Outer Join

## Generic formula

```sql
Select      ColumnList
From        LeftTable
JoinType    RightTable
ON          JoinCondition
```

---
### 1. INNER JOIN

- Returns only the matching rows between both the tables. 
- Non matching rows are eliminated.

#### Syntax:
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

### 2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)
A LEFT JOIN returns all the rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table. If there is no match, the result is NULL on the side of the right table.

#### Syntax:
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

### 3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
A RIGHT JOIN returns all the rows from the right table and the matched rows from the left table. If there is no match, the result is NULL on the side of the left table.

#### Syntax:
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

### 4. FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)
A FULL JOIN returns all the rows when there is a match in either left or right table. If there is no match, the result is NULL from the side where there is no match.

#### Syntax:
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
FULL JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
FULL JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

### 5. CROSS JOIN
- Produces the Cartesian product of the 2 tables involved in the join. 
- For example, in the Employees table we have 10 rows and in the Departments we have 4 rows. So, a cross join between these 2 tables produces 40 rows.

> NOTE: Cross Join shouldn't have ON clause.
#### Syntax:
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;
```

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
CROSS JOIN departments;
```

### 6. SELF JOIN
A SELF JOIN is a regular join but the table is joined with itself. It is useful for querying hierarchical data or comparing rows within the same table.

#### Syntax:
```sql
SELECT A.columns, B.columns
FROM table A, table B
WHERE condition;
```

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT e1.name AS Employee1, e2.name AS Manager
FROM employees e1
INNER JOIN employees e2
ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id;
```

Understanding these types of joins allows for complex querying capabilities and efficient data retrieval from multiple related tables in a SQL Server database.
