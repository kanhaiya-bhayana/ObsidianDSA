- Group by clause is used to group a selected set of rows into a set of summary rows by the values of one or more columns or expressions.
- It is always used in conjunction with one or more aggregate functions



The `GROUP BY` clause in SQL Server is used to arrange identical data into groups with the help of aggregate functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, and `MIN`. It is typically used in conjunction with these functions to perform operations on each group of data.

### Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column1
ORDER BY column1;
```

### Key Points
- `column1`: The column(s) you want to group by.
- `aggregate_function(column2)`: The aggregate function to be applied to the grouped data.
- `table_name`: The table from which to retrieve the data.
- `condition` (optional): Conditions to filter the rows before grouping.
- `ORDER BY` (optional): Specifies the order in which to return the grouped data.

### Aggregate Functions
Common aggregate functions used with `GROUP BY` include:
- `COUNT()`: Counts the number of rows.
- `SUM()`: Calculates the sum of a numerical column.
- `AVG()`: Calculates the average value of a numerical column.
- `MAX()`: Finds the maximum value in a column.
- `MIN()`: Finds the minimum value in a column.

### Examples

#### Basic Group By
```sql
SELECT Department, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfEmployees
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department;
```
This query counts the number of employees in each department.

#### Group By with Multiple Columns
```sql
SELECT Department, JobTitle, AVG(Salary) AS AverageSalary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department, JobTitle;
```
This query calculates the average salary for each job title within each department.

# Group By with Having Clause
The `HAVING` clause is used to filter groups based on a condition. It is similar to the `WHERE` clause, but `WHERE` filters rows before grouping, whereas `HAVING` filters groups after grouping.

```sql
SELECT Department, SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department
HAVING SUM(Salary) > 500000;
```
This query calculates the total salary for each department and returns only those departments where the total salary is greater than 500,000.

### Notes
- Every column in the `SELECT` statement that is not an aggregate function must be included in the `GROUP BY` clause.
- The `HAVING` clause is used to apply conditions to the grouped rows, whereas the `WHERE` clause applies to individual rows before they are grouped.

### Practical Use Cases
- **Reporting**: Summarizing data for reports, such as sales totals by region.
- **Analysis**: Analyzing data trends, such as average spending per customer category.
- **Data Aggregation**: Aggregating large datasets to provide concise insights, such as total revenue per product line.

By using the `GROUP BY` clause effectively, you can perform detailed analysis and generate summary reports from large datasets, providing valuable insights into the underlying data.


## Where VS Having

- WHERE clause is used to filter rows before aggregation, Where as HAVING clause is used to filter groups after aggregations.
- WHERE clause can be used with - Select, Insert, and Update statements, where as HAVING clause can only be used with the Select statement.
- WHERE filters rows before aggregation (GROUPING), where as, HAVING filters groups, after the aggregations are performed.
- Aggregate functions cannot be used in the WHERE clause, unless it is in a sub query contained in a HAVING clause, whereas, aggregate functions can be used in HAVING clause
