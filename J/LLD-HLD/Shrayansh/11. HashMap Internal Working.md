### Internal Working of HashMap in Java

`HashMap` is a widely used data structure in Java that implements the `Map` interface. It stores data in key-value pairs and allows efficient retrieval based on the key. Here's a detailed explanation of how it works internally:

### **Key Components**

1. **Array of Buckets**:
    
    - `HashMap` uses an array to store data, where each element of the array is called a "bucket."
    - Each bucket can hold multiple key-value pairs using a linked list or tree structure.
2. **Hash Function**:
    
    - A hash function generates an integer hash code for a given key.
    - The hash code is then compressed into a valid array index using the formula:  
        **`index = hashCode(key) % arrayLength`**
3. **Node (Entry)**:
    
    - Each bucket stores a linked list (or a tree, depending on the size).
    - Each entry in the list is represented by a `Node` class (nested static class in `HashMap`) with the following structure:
        
        ```java
        static class Node<K, V> implements Map.Entry<K, V> {
            final int hash;
            final K key;
            V value;
            Node<K, V> next;
            // Constructor and methods...
        }
        ```

### **Internal Working**

1. **Adding Elements (Put Operation)**:
    
    - When you call `put(key, value)`, the following steps occur:
        1. **Hashing**:
            - The `hashCode` of the key is computed, and the index in the array is calculated using the hash function.
        2. **Bucket Selection**:
            - The index determines which bucket the key-value pair will go into.
        3. **Collision Handling**:
            - If the bucket is empty, the key-value pair is directly stored.
            - If the bucket already contains one or more nodes:
                - **If the key already exists**: The value is updated.
                - **If the key does not exist**: The new key-value pair is added to the linked list/tree in the bucket.
        4. **Tree Conversion**:
            - If the number of elements in a bucket exceeds a threshold (default is 8), the linked list is converted into a binary search tree (BST) for better performance.
2. **Retrieving Elements (Get Operation)**:
    
    - When you call `get(key)`, the following steps occur:
        1. **Hashing**:
            - The `hashCode` of the key is computed, and the bucket index is determined.
        2. **Bucket Traversal**:
            - The bucket is searched for a node with a matching key:
                - If found, the corresponding value is returned.
                - If not found, `null` is returned.
3. **Removing Elements (Remove Operation)**:
    
    - When you call `remove(key)`, the process is similar to `get(key)`:
        - The bucket is located using the hash code.
        - The linked list/tree is searched for the node with the matching key.
        - The node is removed from the bucket.

### **Important Details**

1. **Rehashing**:
    
    - If the number of elements exceeds a certain threshold (default is 75% of the array size), the `HashMap` dynamically resizes by doubling the array size.
    - All entries are rehashed and redistributed across the new array.
2. **Load Factor**:
    
    - The load factor controls the balance between space and time complexity.
    - Default load factor: **0.75** (rehashing occurs when the map is 75% full).
3. **Time Complexity**:
    
    - **Best Case**: O(1)O(1) for `put`, `get`, and `remove` when collisions are minimal.
    - **Worst Case**: O(n)O(n) if all keys map to the same bucket (extreme hash collision).
4. **Tree-Based Buckets**:
    
    - When a bucket exceeds 8 elements, it converts to a **red-black tree**, reducing the worst-case complexity to O(log‚Å°n)O(\log n).

### Example Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class HashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        // Adding elements
        map.put("One", 1);
        map.put("Two", 2);
        map.put("Three", 3);

        // Accessing elements
        System.out.println("Value for 'Two': " + map.get("Two"));

        // Removing an element
        map.remove("Two");
        System.out.println("After removal: " + map);

        // Checking size
        System.out.println("Size of HashMap: " + map.size());
    }
}
```

### **Advantages**

- Fast lookups and insertions due to hashing.
- Automatically resizes to maintain efficiency.

### **Limitations**

- Does not maintain order of keys or values (use `LinkedHashMap` if order is required).
- Performance degrades with high collision rates.

This structure provides both efficiency and flexibility, making `HashMap` a key part of Java's Collections Framework.




### **Difference Between HashMap, Hashtable, and ConcurrentHashMap**

|Feature|HashMap|Hashtable|ConcurrentHashMap|
|---|---|---|---|
|Thread-Safe|No|Yes (synchronized)|Yes|
|Null Keys/Values|Allowed|Not Allowed|Not Allowed|
|Synchronization|Manual Required|Entire Map Locked|Fine-Grained Locking|
|Performance|High (Single-Threaded)|Low (Synchronized)|High (Multi-Threaded)|

`ConcurrentHashMap` is the go-to choice for thread-safe map implementations in Java due to its balance of performance and thread safety.



Here's a comparison of whether keys or values can be `null` in `HashMap`, `Hashtable`, and `ConcurrentHashMap`:

|Feature|**HashMap**|**Hashtable**|**ConcurrentHashMap**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Null Key**|Allowed (only one `null`)|Not Allowed|Not Allowed|
|**Null Value**|Allowed (multiple `null`s)|Not Allowed|Not Allowed|
