The **Proxy Design Pattern** is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It is often used to add a layer of abstraction or to manage complex behaviors like access control, resource management, or lazy initialization.

### Key Concepts of Proxy Design Pattern

- **Proxy Object**: Acts as an intermediary for the real object, providing controlled access to it.
- **Real Object**: The actual object that contains the core functionality.
- **Client**: Interacts with the proxy as though it were the real object.

The proxy and the real object share the same interface, so the client can use the proxy transparently without knowing whether it is interacting with the proxy or the real object.
