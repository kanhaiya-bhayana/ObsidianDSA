The **Chain of Responsibility** design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows multiple objects to handle a request, with the responsibility for handling the request passed along a chain of handlers. This pattern decouples the sender of the request from the receiver by giving multiple objects the chance to process the request without knowing which one will handle it.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Handler**: An abstract class or interface defining a method to handle requests and a reference to the next handler in the chain.
2. **Concrete Handlers**: Classes that implement the handler interface and either process the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain.
3. **Client**: The component that initiates the request.

### How it Works:

- A request starts at the first handler in the chain.
- If a handler can process the request, it does so; otherwise, it passes the request to the next handler in the chain.
- This process continues until the request is handled or the end of the chain is reached.

### Key Features:

- **Flexibility**: You can dynamically add or remove handlers in the chain.
- **Decoupling**: The client does not need to know which handler will process its request.
- **Responsibility Sharing**: Multiple objects have the opportunity to handle the request.

#### Problem:

Suppose we have Logging System

### Advantages:

- Reduces coupling between sender and receiver.
- Simplifies object responsibilities by dividing processing tasks.
- Enhances flexibility and maintainability.

### Disadvantages:

- Difficult to debug if the chain is too long or has unexpected behavior.
- There is no guarantee that a request will be handled if the chain is not properly configured.
