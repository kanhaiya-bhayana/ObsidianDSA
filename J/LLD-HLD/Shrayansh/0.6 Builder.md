##### When construction gets a little bit too complicated

- Some objects are simple and can be created in a single constructor call.
- Having an object with 10 constructor arguments is not productive

The **Builder design pattern** is a creational pattern used to construct complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of an object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. This pattern is useful when an object has many optional parts or when there are multiple ways to configure an object.



### Benefits of Builder Pattern:

- **Separation of concerns**: Construction logic is separated from the actual representation.
- **Flexibility**: You can create complex objects step by step, without needing to expose the complexity of their construction process to the client.
- **Readability**: The code is more readable and maintainable, especially when objects have many optional parameters.
