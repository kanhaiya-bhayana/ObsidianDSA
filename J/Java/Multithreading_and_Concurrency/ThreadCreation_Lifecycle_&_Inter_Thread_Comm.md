## Thread Creation Ways
1. Implementing `Runnable` interface
2. Extending `Thread` class

### Why 2 ways of Creation?
- A class can implement more than 1 interface
- A class can extend only 1 class


Here‚Äôs a well-structured summary of the **two main ways to create threads in Java**:

## ‚úÖ Ways to Create a Thread in Java

### 1. **Implementing `Runnable` Interface**

#### ‚úÖ Code Example:

```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread using Runnable is running.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        thread.start();
    }
}
```

#### ‚úÖ Notes:

- Preferred for **better OOP design** (since Java supports single inheritance).
    
- The class can **extend another class** and still be a thread.
    
- Can be reused with different `Thread` objects.

### 2. **Extending `Thread` Class**

#### ‚úÖ Code Example:

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread using Thread class is running.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start();
    }
}
```

#### ‚úÖ Notes:

- Easier and quicker for **simple use cases**.
    
- Less flexible ‚Äî your class **can't extend any other class**.

### üîÅ Comparison Table:

|Feature|Runnable Interface|Thread Class|
|---|---|---|
|Inheritance|Allows extending another class|Cannot extend another class|
|Reusability|High (can be shared with Thread)|Low|
|Separation of task & thread|Yes|No|
|Code reuse|Better|Limited|

                     |
                     |   (Thread scheduler picks it)

             +----------------+
             |   Running      |

                     | run() completes or stop()

| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **New**           | Thread created but not started.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Runnable**      | Ready to run, waiting for CPU time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Running**       | Actually executing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Blocked**       | Different scenarios where runnalbe thread goes into the Blocking state:<br>- I/O: like reading from a file or database<br>- Lock acquired: if thread want to lock on a resource which is  locked by other thread, it has to wait.<br><br>> Release all the MONITOR LOCKS |
| **Waiting**       | - Thread goes into this state when we call the wait() method, makes it non runnable.<br>- Its goes back to runnable, once we call notify() or notifyAll() method.<br>- Release all the MONITOR LOCKS.                                                                    |
| **Timed Waiting** | - Waiting for a period (e.g., `sleep(1000)`, `join(timeout)`).<br>- Do not release any MONITOR LOCK.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Terminated**    | - Finished execution or aborted.<br>- Life of thread is completed, it can not be  started back again.                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Monitor Lock
- It helps to make sure that only 1 thread goes inside the particular section of code (a synchronized block or method).
