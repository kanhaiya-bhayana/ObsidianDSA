# üîë Key Programming Terms (Beginner to Advanced)

## üß† Basic Execution Concepts

| Term            | Meaning                                                                 | Example / Analogy                                                                 |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Synchronous** | Tasks run **one at a time**, in order.                                  | Like standing in a queue ‚Äî each person is served one after another.               |
| **Asynchronous**| Tasks **start** and can **finish later**, without waiting.              | Ordering food and getting a text when it's ready.                                 |
| **Concurrent**  | Multiple tasks are **in progress** during the same time frame.          | Cooking while laundry is running ‚Äî overlapping work.                              |
| **Parallel**    | Tasks run at **exactly the same time**, using multiple threads/cores.   | Two chefs cooking two dishes at the same time.                                    |
| **Blocking**    | A task that **halts the program** until it's finished.                  | Waiting at a red light before doing anything else.                                |
| **Non-blocking**| Program **keeps running** while waiting for something to finish.        | You send a message and continue doing other tasks.                                |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Async/Promise Concepts

| Term              | Meaning                                                                 | Example / Analogy                                                                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Promise**        | Represents a future value or failure from an async operation.           | "I promise to give you the result later."                                         |
| **Callback**       | Function passed to another function to be called **later**.             | Leave your number to be called back when ready.                                   |
| **Microtask**      | Small async tasks run **immediately after** current code.               | `.then()` callbacks.                                                              |
| **Macrotask**      | Larger async tasks (e.g., timers) run **after** microtasks.             | `setTimeout`, event handlers.                                                     |
| **Event Loop**     | Mechanism that handles execution of sync and async code in JS.          | A manager checking and running task queues.                                       |
| **Settled (Promise)** | A promise that is either **fulfilled** or **rejected**.              | It's done ‚Äî can‚Äôt change again.                                                   |

## üß™ Threading & Execution

| Term           | Meaning                                                                 | Example / Analogy                                                                   |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Thread**      | A single sequence of execution in a program.                            | One worker on a factory line.                                                       |
| **Process**     | A running program with its own memory space.                            | A full factory.                                                                     |
| **Race Condition**| Two tasks access or change the same data at the same time.            | Two people editing the same doc at once without rules.                             |
| **Deadlock**     | Two tasks waiting on each other, and neither can proceed.              | Two people both waiting for each other to speak first.                             |

## ‚ö° JavaScript Essentials

| Term              | Meaning                                                                | Example / Analogy                                                                 |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Closure**        | Function that remembers variables from its outer scope.               | A backpack that keeps old variables with the function.                            |
| **Scope**          | Where a variable is accessible in your code.                         | Room where certain tools (variables) are available.                               |
| **Hoisting**       | JS moves declarations to the top of the scope.                       | "Declared later, available earlier."                                              |
| **IIFE**           | Immediately Invoked Function Expression.                             | `(function() { ... })();` runs right away.                                        |
| **Prototype**      | Inheritance mechanism in JS.                                          | Objects inheriting behavior from other objects.                                   |

## üß∞ Performance & Patterns

| Term           | Meaning                                                                 | Example / Analogy                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Throttle**     | Limits how often a function can run.                                   | Check email only once every 10 minutes.                                           |
| **Debounce**     | Waits for a pause in activity before running.                         | Save form after user stops typing.                                                |
| **Memoization**  | Cache function results for faster future access.                      | Remember past answers to avoid repeating work.                                    |
| **Currying**     | Breaking function with multiple args into smaller functions.           | `sum(2)(3)` instead of `sum(2, 3)`                                                |
| **Pure Function**| Function with no side effects; same input ‚Üí same output.              | Like a math function: `f(x) = x + 1`                                              |
| **Side Effect**  | When a function changes something outside itself.                     | Writing to a file, modifying a global variable, etc.                              |
| **Immutability** | Data that can't be changed after it's created.                        | Like constants in math or frozen objects.                                         |

## üìå Bonus Interview Tips

- Be clear about **concurrency vs parallelism**.
- Always explain with **examples or analogies**.
- Use real code examples if asked ‚Äî especially for **promises, closures, hoisting**, etc.
