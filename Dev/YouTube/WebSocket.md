### **What is WebSocket?**

WebSocket is a **full-duplex communication protocol** that allows a persistent, bidirectional connection between a client and a server. It operates over **a single TCP connection** and enables real-time data exchange with minimal latency.

### **Why Do We Need WebSocket?**

Traditional HTTP requests are **stateless** and follow a **request-response model**, which means the client has to repeatedly make requests (polling) to get updated information. This approach is inefficient for real-time applications. WebSockets solve this problem by:

- **Reducing Latency:** Unlike HTTP, WebSockets keep a persistent connection, eliminating the need for repeated requests.
- **Efficient Data Exchange:** WebSockets use a **single, long-lived connection** instead of creating a new connection for every request.
- **Real-time Communication:** Ideal for applications requiring instant data updates, such as:
    - Chat applications (WhatsApp, Slack)
    - Live stock market updates
    - Online gaming
    - Collaborative tools (Google Docs real-time editing)

---

### How is WebSocket Different from HTTP?

|Feature|WebSocket|HTTP|
|---|---|---|
|**Communication**|Full-duplex (both client & server can send messages anytime)|Half-duplex (client requests, server responds)|
|**Connection**|Persistent, single TCP connection|New connection for each request-response cycle|
|**Latency**|Low latency|Higher latency due to repeated requests|
|**Overhead**|Minimal overhead after initial handshake|More overhead due to repeated request headers|
|**Data Format**|Supports binary and text-based messages|Usually text-based (JSON, HTML, XML)|
|**Use Case**|Real-time applications (chat, stock updates, gaming)|Static content, REST APIs, file downloads|

---

### **Conclusion**

If you need **real-time, two-way communication**, WebSockets are a better choice than HTTP. However, if your application primarily deals with **RESTful APIs, file downloads, or traditional request-response interactions**, HTTP is sufficient.

### **What is SSE (Server-Sent Events)?**

**Server-Sent Events (SSE)** is a unidirectional, **server-to-client streaming** protocol that allows a server to push updates to the client over a persistent HTTP connection.

SSE is built on top of HTTP and uses **EventSource API** in browsers to receive automatic updates from the server.

---

### **Why Do We Need SSE?**

SSE is useful when the **server needs to continuously push data updates to the client**, such as:

- **Live news feeds**
- **Stock market price updates**
- **Real-time notifications**
- **Sports scores updates**

Since SSE maintains a long-lived connection and automatically reconnects if the connection drops, it is a great alternative to WebSockets for simple real-time updates.

---

### **Why Can‚Äôt We Use SSE Instead of WebSockets?**

Although SSE and WebSockets **both support real-time communication**, they have key differences:

|Feature|SSE (Server-Sent Events)|WebSocket|
|---|---|---|
|**Communication Type**|**Unidirectional** (Server ‚Üí Client)|**Bidirectional** (Client ‚Üî Server)|
|**Connection**|Persistent HTTP connection|Persistent TCP connection|
|**Use Case**|Server push notifications, live feeds|Chat apps, gaming, collaborative tools|
|**Reconnection Handling**|Built-in automatic reconnection|Requires custom handling|
|**Data Format**|Only supports text (UTF-8)|Supports text and binary (JSON, images, etc.)|
|**Scalability**|Works with standard HTTP and proxies|May require WebSocket-compatible proxies|
|**Browser Support**|Widely supported in modern browsers|Requires WebSocket-compatible client & server|

---

### **When to Use SSE vs. WebSockets?**

‚úîÔ∏è **Use SSE when:**

- The communication is **one-way** (server ‚Üí client).
- You need **simpler implementation** over HTTP.
- Automatic reconnection is beneficial.

‚úîÔ∏è **Use WebSockets when:**

- **Bidirectional communication** is needed.
- You need **low latency** interactions (e.g., chat apps, gaming).
- You want to **send binary data** (e.g., images, files).

---

### **Conclusion**

SSE is **great for server-to-client updates**, but it **cannot** replace WebSockets when the client also needs to send messages to the server in real-time. If your application requires bidirectional communication, WebSockets are the better choice.



### **WebSockets vs. WebRTC: Why Use WebSockets?**

WebSockets and WebRTC both enable real-time communication, but **they serve different purposes** and are optimized for different use cases.

---

### **What is WebRTC?**

**WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)** is a protocol for **peer-to-peer (P2P)** communication that enables **audio, video, and data sharing** between browsers **without requiring a server** for media transmission.

---

### **WebRTC vs. WebSockets: Key Differences**

|Feature|**WebRTC**|**WebSockets**|
|---|---|---|
|**Communication Type**|Peer-to-peer (P2P)|Client-server|
|**Data Type**|Audio, video, and data|Only data (text & binary)|
|**Connection Model**|Decentralized|Centralized|
|**Latency**|Extremely low (direct connection)|Low but not as fast as P2P|
|**Media Streaming**|Yes, optimized for real-time audio/video|No, only data transfer|
|**Requires Server?**|No (except for signaling)|Yes, always|
|**Scalability**|Harder to scale (P2P limitations)|Easier to scale (centralized model)|

---

### **Why Use WebSockets Instead of WebRTC?**

Even though **WebRTC supports data transfer**, WebSockets are preferred in many cases:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **WebRTC Requires a Complex Setup**

- WebRTC needs **signaling servers** for peer discovery and establishing a connection.
- WebSockets provide **a direct client-server model**, making them simpler to implement.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **WebRTC is Overkill for Simple Data Exchange**

- WebRTC is optimized for **audio/video streaming**.
- If you only need **text or binary data** (e.g., chat, real-time updates), WebSockets are **lighter and simpler**.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **WebRTC Struggles with Firewalls & NAT**

- WebRTC **relies on peer-to-peer connections**, which can be blocked by **strict corporate firewalls**.
- WebSockets work over **standard HTTP/HTTPS ports (80/443)**, making them easier to use in restricted networks.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **WebRTC is Not Ideal for Centralized Applications**

- If data must be **processed, logged, or stored** on the server (e.g., real-time analytics, stock updates), WebSockets provide a better structure.
- WebRTC **bypasses the server**, making centralized logging difficult.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Scalability & Load Balancing**

- WebRTC **scales poorly** for applications like **massive multiplayer games, stock market updates, or collaborative apps** because every client needs direct connections.
- WebSockets allow **better control, scalability, and load balancing** via servers.

---

### **When to Use WebRTC vs. WebSockets?**

‚úîÔ∏è **Use WebRTC when:**

- You need **real-time audio/video streaming** (e.g., Zoom, Google Meet).
- **Peer-to-peer file sharing** is required.
- You want **low-latency direct connections** (e.g., multiplayer gaming).

‚úîÔ∏è **Use WebSockets when:**

- You need **real-time data updates** (e.g., stock prices, notifications).
- You want a **client-server model** (e.g., live chat, collaborative tools).
- **Firewall compatibility and easy deployment** are important.

---

### **Conclusion**

WebRTC is great for **peer-to-peer media streaming**, but **WebSockets are the better choice for real-time, event-driven data transfer** in client-server applications. If your use case does not involve audio/video, WebSockets are simpler, more reliable, and easier to scale. üöÄ

#### 2 Interview Questions
###### 1. Why not WebRTC, It also does the same job?
WebRTC, uses the UDP, which not 

‚úÖ **Low Latency**: UDP does not establish a persistent connection like TCP, so it **sends packets faster**, making it ideal for real-time applications.  
‚úÖ **No Retransmissions**: If a packet is lost, WebRTC does **not wait** for it to be resent, avoiding delays.  
‚úÖ **Adaptive Streaming**: WebRTC can dynamically adjust video/audio quality based on network conditions.  
‚ùå **No Guarantee of Delivery**: Some packets may be lost or arrive out of order, but WebRTC handles this with error correction techniques.

**Use Case:** Voice/video calls, online gaming, live streaming.
###### 2. What is the 1st request client sends to server in WebSocket?
Http request handshake and returns the 101, Switching Protocol Response

‚úÖ **Reliable Data Transfer**: TCP ensures that all packets are delivered **in order** and **without loss**.  
‚úÖ **Persistent Connection**: WebSockets maintain a continuous, **bidirectional** connection between client and server.  
‚úÖ **Ideal for Messaging**: Since data is received exactly as sent, WebSockets are great for **chat applications** or **real-time notifications**.  
‚ùå **Higher Latency**: Retransmissions and connection overhead can cause slight delays.

**Use Case:** Chat apps, stock market updates, collaborative apps (Google Docs, Trello).
