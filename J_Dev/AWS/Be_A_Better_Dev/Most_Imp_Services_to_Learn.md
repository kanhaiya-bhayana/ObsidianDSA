# Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

## What is VPC?

**Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** is a foundational AWS service that enables you to launch AWS resources in a logically isolated, virtual network that you define. It closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of AWS's scalable infrastructure.

---

## Key Features

- **Isolation:**  
  Each VPC is logically isolated from other VPCs and AWS accounts, ensuring network security and privacy.

- **Customizable Network Configuration:**  
  - Define your own IP address ranges (IPv4 and IPv6).
  - Create subnets (public, private, or isolated).
  - Configure route tables, network gateways, and security settings.

- **Security Controls:**  
  - Use security groups (virtual firewalls for instances) and network ACLs (stateless firewalls for subnets).
  - Control inbound and outbound traffic at both the instance and subnet level.

- **Connectivity Options:**  
  - **Internet Gateway:** Enables internet access for public subnets.
  - **NAT Gateway/Instance:** Allows private subnets to access the internet securely.
  - **VPC Peering:** Connects multiple VPCs for private communication.
  - **VPN & Direct Connect:** Securely connect your on-premises network to your AWS VPC.

- **Integration:**  
  Integrates with most AWS services (EC2, RDS, Lambda, ECS, etc.) for secure, private deployments.

---

## Common Use Cases

- Hosting web applications with public and private subnets.
- Isolating development, testing, and production environments.
- Securely connecting to on-premises data centers.
- Enabling hybrid cloud architectures.

---

## Azure Equivalent

- **Azure Virtual Network (VNet):**  
  Provides similar functionality for network isolation and management in Microsoft Azure.
