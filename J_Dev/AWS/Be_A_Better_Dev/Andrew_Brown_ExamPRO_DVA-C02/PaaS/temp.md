## EB - Immutable
- Creats a new ASG group with EC2 instances.
- Deploy the updated version of the app on the new EC2 instances.
- Point the ELB to the new ASG and delete the old ASG which will terminate the old EC2 instances.

```
The safest way to deploy for critical applications.

**Note**: In case of failure, you just terminate the new instances since the existing instances still remain.

## EB - Deployment Methods
Here‚Äôs the table from your image, formatted in Markdown so you can include it on your wiki page:

### Legend:
- **Deploy Time:**
  - ‚è± = Short
  - ‚è±‚è± = Moderate
  - ‚è±‚è±‚è± = Long
- üî¥ = Yes
- üü¢ = No
- üî∑ = No Change

‚Ä† Time may vary  
‚Ä†‚Ä† Time varies depending on evaluation time option setting
```

Improvements include:

* Consistent column widths.
* Clear ‚úÖ/üî¥/üü¢ symbols for Yes/No for quick scanning.
* Added a *Legend* section at the bottom for symbols.
* Replaced some wordiness with clearer phrases.
