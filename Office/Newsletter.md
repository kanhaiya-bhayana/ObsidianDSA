### **Rendezvous with North Stars**

**1. How long have you been at Incedo?**  
I joined Incedo as a Software Engineer Trainee in 2023 and have been growing with the company ever since.

**2. How did you feel when you first joined Incedo and how has your perception evolved over the years?**  
When I first joined, I was excited yet slightly nervous about stepping into the corporate world. However, I quickly realized that Incedo fosters a culture of learning and collaboration. Initially, I believed that success was all about individual contributions—trying to solve everything on my own. But over time, I’ve come to understand that software development is not about a single person completing an entire application; it’s about teamwork, collaboration, and leveraging collective expertise.

**3. What were your expectations when you joined, and how have they been met or exceeded?**  
I expected to work on challenging projects, gain hands-on experience, and grow as a professional. Incedo has exceeded my expectations by providing exposure to cutting-edge technologies, Agile methodologies, and a supportive team that encourages creative problem-solving.

**4. What has been your proudest moment or achievement so far at Incedo?**  
One of my proudest moments was successfully delivering a complex microservices-based project while optimizing system performance. Additionally, mentoring junior developers and sharing my knowledge especially on cloud-native development with Docker and cloud-specific implementations with Azure has been incredibly rewarding.

**5. How did the company’s culture influence your early experience and growth?**  
The collaborative and innovation-driven culture at Incedo played a pivotal role in my early growth. The emphasis on learning, knowledge sharing, and teamwork helped me transition smoothly from a trainee to a full-time Software Engineer.

When I first joined, I was excited yet slightly nervous about stepping into the corporate world. Concepts like Clean Architecture and Microservices felt overwhelming—almost like, How will I ever master these? But over time, with hands-on experience and mentorship, these have become part of my daily vocabulary. Incedo’s culture of learning and innovation has played a huge role in this transformation, making every challenge an opportunity to grow.


**6. What advice would you give new hires to make the most of their first few years at the company?**  
Stay curious, be proactive, and never hesitate to ask questions. Leverage the knowledge of your peers and mentors, participate in discussions, and embrace challenges as learning opportunities.

**7. Who have been your mentors and role models during your Incedo journey so far?**  
I have been fortunate to learn from multiple mentors who have guided me in different aspects of my career, from technical expertise to professional growth. Anuj (Manager) and Kartik (Senior Engineer) have played a crucial role in shaping my technical skills and approach to problem-solving, while Chaitanya (one of my colleagues) has been a great source of collaboration and learning. Their insights, support, and encouragement have been instrumental in my journey at Incedo.


**8. What’s one thing people might be surprised to learn about you outside of work?**  
Beyond coding and tech discussions, I enjoy creating content on software development topics and sharing my learnings on platforms like YouTube and LinkedIn.
