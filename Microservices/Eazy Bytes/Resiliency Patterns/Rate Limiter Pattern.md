The rate limiter pattern is a design pattern used in microservice architecture to control the rate at which requests are allowed to be processed by a service. It is primarily used to prevent overloading services, ensuring they remain responsive and can handle incoming requests without failure or significant performance degradation. Hereâ€™s an overview of how the rate limiter pattern works and its benefits:

### How Rate Limiter Pattern Works

1. **Defining Limits**: Set thresholds for the number of requests a service can handle within a specific time window. For example, a service might be limited to 100 requests per second.
    
2. **Counting Requests**: Keep track of the incoming requests in real-time or over specified intervals. This can be done using various algorithms and data structures (like token buckets, leaky buckets, or sliding windows).
    
3. **Enforcing Limits**: When the request rate exceeds the defined limit, additional requests are either delayed, rejected, or throttled back to a manageable level.
    
4. **Response to Excess Requests**: The system decides what to do with the excess requests. Common responses include returning HTTP status codes such as 429 (Too Many Requests) or queuing the requests for later processing.
    

### Common Algorithms for Rate Limiting

1. **Token Bucket**: Tokens are added to a bucket at a fixed rate. Each incoming request consumes a token. If the bucket is empty, the request is denied or delayed until tokens are available again.
    
2. **Leaky Bucket**: Requests flow into a bucket at any rate but are processed at a fixed rate. If the bucket overflows, incoming requests are dropped or delayed.
    
3. **Fixed Window**: Limits the number of requests within a fixed time window. For example, no more than 100 requests per minute.
    
4. **Sliding Window**: Similar to the fixed window but provides more granularity by dividing the window into smaller segments and maintaining counters for these segments to smooth out the burst handling.
    

### Benefits of Using Rate Limiter Pattern

1. **Prevents Service Overload**: By controlling the rate of incoming requests, services are protected from being overwhelmed by high traffic, ensuring stability and availability.
    
2. **Improves User Experience**: By maintaining the performance of the services, users experience fewer delays and timeouts.
    
3. **Fair Usage**: Ensures that all clients have fair access to the service, preventing any single client from monopolizing resources.
    
4. **Cost Management**: Helps manage operational costs by preventing overuse of resources, which might lead to increased infrastructure costs.
    
5. **Security**: Mitigates certain types of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks where the attacker tries to overwhelm the service with a flood of requests.
    

### Implementation in Microservices

In a microservices architecture, the rate limiter can be implemented at different levels:

1. **API Gateway**: Rate limiting can be applied at the gateway level to control the rate of requests entering the system. Tools like Kong, NGINX, and Amazon API Gateway offer built-in rate limiting features.
    
2. **Service Mesh**: Service meshes like Istio and Linkerd can apply rate limiting policies across the microservices in a consistent manner.
    
3. **Within Microservices**: Individual microservices can implement their own rate limiting logic using libraries like Guava RateLimiter (Java), Python's `ratelimit` library, or custom logic.
    
4. **External Services**: External rate limiting services like Redis (using its atomic increment operations) or dedicated rate limiting services like RateLimit.io can be used to centralize and manage rate limiting across services.



## The Redis RateLimiter Pattern

The algorithm used is the Token Bucket Algorithm

#### Contains 3 Properties
1. ReplenishRate - How many requests per second to allow
2. BurstCapacity - No. of tokens the token bucket can hold
3. RequestedTokens - How many tokens a request costs. this is the number of tokens taken from the bucket for each request and defaults to 1.
