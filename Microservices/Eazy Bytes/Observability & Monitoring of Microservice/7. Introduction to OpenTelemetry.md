OpenTelemetry **provides a single, open source standard, and a set of technologies to capture and export metrics, traces, and logs from your cloud-native applications and infrastructure**. Modern cloud-native applications are distributed, making the capture and export of telemetry data complicated.

#### What is the use of OpenTelemetry?
OpenTelemetry is used **to collect telemetry data from distributed systems in order to troubleshoot, debug and manage applications and their host environment**. It offers an easy way for IT and developer teams to instrument their code base for data collection and make adjustments as the organization grows.
