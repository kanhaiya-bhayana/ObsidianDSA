#### Spring Cloud Sleuth

Spring Cloud Sleuth provides Spring Boot auto-configuration for distributed tracing.

#### Features 
Sleuth configures everything you need to get started. This includes where trace data (spans) are reported to, how many traces to keep (sampling), if remote fields (baggage) are sent, and which libraries are traced.
