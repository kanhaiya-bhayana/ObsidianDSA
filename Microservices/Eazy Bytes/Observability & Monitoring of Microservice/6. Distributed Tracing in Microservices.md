Event logs, health probes, and metrics offer a wealth of valuable information for deducing the internal condition of an application. Nevertheless, these sources fail to account for the distributed nature of cloud-native applications. Given that a user request often traverses multiple applications, we currently lack the means to effectively correlate data across application boundaries.

Distributed tracing is a technique used in microservices or cloud-native applications to understand and analyze the flow of requests as they propagate across multiple services and components. It helps in gaining insights into how requests are processed, identifying performance bottlenecks, and diagnosing issues in complex, distributed systems.

One possible solution to address this issue is to implement a straightforward approach where a unique identifier, knows as a correlation ID, is generated for each request at the entry point of the system. This correlation ID can then be utilized in event logs and passed along to other relevant services involved in processing the request. By leveraging this correlation ID, we can retrieve all log messages associated with a specific transaction from multiple applications.

##### Distributed tracing encompasses three primary concepts:
- **Tags** serve as metadata that offer supplementary details about the span context, including the request URI, the username of authenticated user, or the identifier for a specific tenant.
- A trace denotes the collection of actions tied to a request or transaction, distinguished by a **trace ID**. It consists of multiple spans that span across various services. 
- A **span** represents each individual stage of request processing, encompassing start and end timestamps, and is uniquely identified by the combination of trace ID and span ID.
