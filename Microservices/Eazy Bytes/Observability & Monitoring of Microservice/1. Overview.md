## DEBUGGING A PROBLEM IN MICROSERVICES?

1. How do we trace transactions across multiple services, containers and try to find where exactly the problem or bug is?

2. How do we combine all the logs from multiple services into a central location where they can be indexed, searched, filtered, and grouped to find bugs that are contributing to a problem?


## MONITORING PERFORMACE OF SERVICES CALLS?

1. How can we track the path of a specific chain services call through our microservices network, and see how long it took to complete at each microservice?


## MONITORING SERVICES METRICS & HEALTH?

1. How can we easily and efficiently monitor the metrics like CPU usage, JVM metrics, etc. For all the microservices applications in our network?
2. How can we monitor the status and health of all of our microservices applications in a single place, and create alerts and notifications for any abnormal behavior of the services?


## SOLUTION

> Observability and Monitoring solve the challenge of identifying and resolving above problems in microservices architectures before they cause outages.
