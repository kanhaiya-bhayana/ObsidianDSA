###### Avoid temporal coupling whenever possible
Temporal coupling occurs when a caller service expects an immediate response from a callee service before continuing its processing. If the callee experiences any delay in responding, it negatively impacts the overall response time of the caller. This scenario commonly arises in synchronous communication between services. How can we prevent temporal coupling and mitigate its effects?
###### Using asynchronous communication  
Synchronous communication between services is not always necessary. In many real-world scenarios, asynchronous communication can fulfill the requirements effectively. So, how can we establish asynchronous communication between  
services?
###### Building event driven microservices  
An event, as an incident, signifies a significant occurrence within a system, such as a state transition. Multiple sources can generate events. When an event takes place, it is possible to alert the concerned parties. How can one go about constructing event-driven services with these characteristics?

Event-driven microservices can be built using ***Event-driven architecture***, ***producing and consuming events using Async communication, event brokers, Spring Cloud Function, Spring Cloud Stream.*** Let's explore the world of event-driven microservices.

An event-driven microservice architecture is a design pattern in which microservices communicate with each other by emitting and consuming events. This architecture promotes loose coupling and allows for better scalability and flexibility. Here's a simple example to illustrate this concept:

## Scenario
Imagine an e-commerce platform where the system consists of various microservices such as:

1. **Order Service**: Handles the creation and management of orders.
2. **Inventory Service**: Manages product inventory.
3. **Shipping Service**: Handles the shipping process.
4. **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to customers.
## Event-Driven Flow

### Step 1: Order Creation
When a customer places an order, the Order Service creates a new order and emits an `OrderCreated` event.

### Step 2: Inventory Update
The Inventory Service listens for the `OrderCreated` event. When it receives this event, it updates the inventory by reducing the stock of the ordered items and emits an `InventoryUpdated` event.

### Step 3: Shipping Process
The Shipping Service listens for the `InventoryUpdated` event. Upon receiving this event, it initiates the shipping process and emits a `ShippingStarted` event.

### Step 4: Customer Notification
The Notification Service listens for both `OrderCreated` and `ShippingStarted` events. It sends an order confirmation email when it receives the `OrderCreated` event and a shipping notification email when it receives the `ShippingStarted` event.
