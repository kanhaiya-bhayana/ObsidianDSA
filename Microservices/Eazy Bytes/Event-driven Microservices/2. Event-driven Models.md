#### Event-driven architectures can be built using two primary models
###### 1. Publisher/Subscriber (Pub/Sub) Model  
This model revolves around subscriptions. Producers generate events that are distributed to all subscribers for consumption. Once an event is received, it cannot be replayed, which means new subscribers joining later will not have access to past events.

###### 2. Event Streaming Model
In this model, events are written to a log in a sequential manner. Producers publish events as they occur, and these events are stored in a well-ordered fashion. Instead of subscribing to events, consumers have the ability to read from any part of the event stream. One advantage of this model is that events can be replayed, allowing clients to join at any time and receive all past events.


> The pub/sub model is frequently paired with ***"RabbitMQ"*** as a popular option. On the other hand, ***"Apache Kafka"*** is a robust platform widely utilized for event stream processing.
