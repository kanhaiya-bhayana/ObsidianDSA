Spring Cloud Stream is a framework designed for creating scalable, event-driven, and streaming applications. Its core principle is to allow developers to focus on the business logic while the framework takes care of infrastructure-related tasks, such as integrating with a message broker.

Spring Cloud Stream leverages the native capabilities of each message broker, while also providing an abstraction layer to ensure a consistent experience regardless of the underlying middleware. By just adding a dependency to your project, you can have functions automatically connected to an external message broker. The beauty of this approach is that you don't need to modify any application code; your simply adjust the configuration in the application.yml file.

The framework supports integrations with RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, Kafka Streams, and Amazon Kinesis. There are also integrations maintained by partners for Google PubSub, Solace PubSub+, Azure Event Hubs, and Apache RokcetMQ.

###### The core building blocks of Spring Cloud Stream are:\

###### 1. Destination Binders
Components responsible to provide integration with the external messaging systems.
###### 2. Destination Bindings
Bridge between the external messaging systems and application code (producer/consumer) provided by the end user.
###### 3. Message
The canonical data structure used by producers and consumers to communicate with Destination Binders (and thus other applications via external messaging systems).
