###### There are few Steps:
> In the step 1, where client is making a request to Auth Server endpoint, have to send the below important details,
- client_id & client-secret - the credentials of the client to authenticate itself.
- scope - similar to authorities. Specifies level of access that client is requesting like EMAIL, PROFILE
- grant_type - With the value 'client_credentials' which indicates that we want to follow client credentials grant type

> This is the most simplest grant type flow in OAuth2
> We use this authentication flow only if there is no user and UI involved. Like in the scenarios where 2 different applications want to share data between them using backend APIs.
