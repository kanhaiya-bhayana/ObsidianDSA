OAuth2 (Open Authorization 2) is an authorization framework that allows third-party applications to obtain limited access to a web service, without exposing the user’s credentials. It's widely used for securing API access.

OAuth stands for Open Authorization. It's a free and open protocol, build on IETF standards and licenses from the Open Web Foundation, OAuth 2.1 is a security standard where you give one application permission to access your data in another application. The step to grant permission, or consent, are often referred to as authorization or even delegated authorization. You authorize one application to access your data, or use features in another application on your behalf, without giving them your password.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Resource Owner**: The user who owns the data and can grant access to it.
2. **Client**: The application requesting access to the user’s data.
3. **Authorization Server**: The server that authenticates the resource owner and issues access tokens to the client.
4. **Resource Server**: The server hosting the protected resources, which accepts access tokens to grant access to the data.

### OAuth2 Flow:
1. **Authorization Grant**: The user grants permission to the client to access their resources.
2. **Authorization Code**: The client receives an authorization code from the authorization server.
3. **Access Token**: The client exchanges the authorization code for an access token.
4. **API Access**: The client uses the access token to access the resource server.

### Grant Types:
1. **Authorization Code Grant**: Used for server-side applications. It involves an intermediate code, which adds an extra layer of security.
2. **Implicit Grant**: Used for client-side applications, where tokens are issued directly to the client.
3. **Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant**: Used when the user trusts the client with their credentials.
4. **Client Credentials Grant**: Used for machine-to-machine authentication, where the client accesses its own resources.

### Security Considerations:
- **Scopes**: Define what resources the client can access.
- **Refresh Tokens**: Allow the client to obtain new access tokens without user involvement.
- **Token Expiry**: Limits the lifetime of access tokens to reduce the impact of a stolen token.

OAuth2 is widely used in various applications, including social media platforms, cloud services, and enterprise environments, providing a secure and user-friendly way to manage authorization and access control.

### Below are the few advantages of OAuth2 standard
**Supports all kinds of Apps:** OAuth2 supports multiple use cases addressing different device capabilities. It supports server-to-server apps, browser-based apps, mobile/native apps, IoT devices consoles/TVs. It has various authorization grant flows like Authorization code grant, Client Credentials Grant Type etc. to support all kinds of apps communication.


**Separation of Auth logic:** Inside OAuth2, we have Authorization Server which receives requests from the Client for Access Tokens and issues them upon successful authentication. This enable us to maintain all the security logic in a single place. Regardless of how many applications an organization has, they all can connect to Auth server to perform login operation.

All user credentials & client application credentials will be maintained in a single location which is inside Auth Server.

**No need to share Credentials:** If you plan to allow a third-party applications and services to access your resources, then there is no need to share your credentials.  

In many ways, you can think of the OAuth2 token as a "access card" at any office/hotel. These tokens provides limited access to someone, without handing over full control in the form of the master key.
