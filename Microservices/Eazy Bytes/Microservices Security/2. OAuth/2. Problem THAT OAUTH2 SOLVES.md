Why should we use OAUTH2 framework for implementing security inside our microservices? Why can't we use the basic authentication? To answer this, first lets try to understand the basic authentication & it's drawbacks.

Early websites usually ask for credentials via an HTML form, which the browser will send to the server. The server authenticates the information and writes a session value in the cookie; as long as the session is still marked active, user can access protected features and resources.
###### Drawbacks of Basic authentication  
- Backend server or business logic is tightly coupled with the Authentication/Authorization logic. Not mobile Flow/ REST APIs Friendly. 
- Basic authentication flow does not accommodate well the use case where users of one product or service would like to grant third-party clients access to their information on the platform.
