```java
import java.lang.Exception;
```

- In Java, an exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of a program's execution. 
- It is an object that the runtime system creates and passes to the method where the error occurred. 
- Handling exceptions is crucial to creating robust and error-free programs.


## Types of Exceptions

1. **Checked Exceptions**:
	- These are exceptions that are checked at compile-time.
	- The programmer must handle these exceptions, either by using a try-catch block or by declaring the exception using the `throws` keyword.
	- Examples include `IOException`, `SQLException`, and `ClassNotFoundException`.

2. **Unchecked Exceptions**:
	-  These are exceptions that are not checked at compile-time but at runtime.
	- They are subclasses of `RuntimeException`.
	- Examples include `NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, and `ArithmeticException`.

3. **Errors**:
    - Errors are serious problems that applications should not try to catch.
    - They are usually external to the application and often represent catastrophic failure, such as `OutOfMemoryError` and `StackOverflowError`.
    - They are subclasses of `Error`.


## Exception Handling

Java provides a powerful mechanism to handle exceptions through the following keywords:

1. **try**: A block of code that might throw an exception.
2. **catch**: A block of code that handles the exception thrown by the try block.
3. **finally**: A block of code that will execute after the try block and any catch block(s), regardless of whether an exception was thrown or not.
4. **throw**: Used to explicitly throw an exception.
5. **throws**: Used in method signatures to declare that a method might throw exceptions.



### Example

Here's an example to illustrate exception handling in Java:

```java
public class ExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
            System.out.println(numbers[3]);  // This will throw ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
        } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
            System.out.println("Array index is out of bounds: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            System.out.println("This block always executes.");
        }
    }
}
```


### Key Points

- Exceptions provide a way to react to exceptional circumstances (like runtime errors) in programs by transferring control to special code blocks (catch blocks).
- Proper exception handling can make your program more robust and prevent it from crashing due to unhandled errors.
- Use checked exceptions for recoverable conditions and runtime exceptions for programming errors.
### Scenario: Bank Account Withdrawals

Imagine you have a banking application, and you need to handle cases where a withdrawal amount exceeds the available balance. You can create a custom exception called `InsufficientFundsException` to handle this specific error condition.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Define the Custom Exception Class**: Create a class `InsufficientFundsException` that extends the `Exception` class.
    
2. **Implement the Bank Account Class**: Create a `BankAccount` class that manages deposits and withdrawals, and uses the custom exception to handle insufficient funds.
    
3. **Test the Custom Exception**: Create a main class to test the custom exception by attempting a withdrawal that exceeds the available balance.
    

### Custom Exception Class

```java
public class InsufficientFundsException extends Exception {
    private double amount;

    public InsufficientFundsException(double amount) {
        super("Insufficient funds for withdrawal: " + amount);
        this.amount = amount;
    }

    public double getAmount() {
        return amount;
    }
}
```
### Bank Account Class

```java
public class BankAccount {
    private double balance;

    public BankAccount(double initialBalance) {
        if (initialBalance < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Initial balance cannot be negative.");
        }
        this.balance = initialBalance;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Deposit amount must be positive.");
        }
        balance += amount;
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) throws InsufficientFundsException {
        if (amount <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Withdrawal amount must be positive.");
        }
        if (amount > balance) {
            throw new InsufficientFundsException(amount);
        }
        balance -= amount;
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}
```

### Main Class to Test the Custom Exception

```java
public class BankApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount(100.0);  // Create account with initial balance of $100

        try {
            System.out.println("Current balance: $" + account.getBalance());
            account.withdraw(150.0);  // Attempt to withdraw $150
        } catch (InsufficientFundsException e) {
            System.out.println("Exception caught: " + e.getMessage());
            System.out.println("Requested amount: $" + e.getAmount());
        }
        
        System.out.println("Current balance after withdrawal attempt: $" + account.getBalance());
    }
}
```
### Explanation

1. **InsufficientFundsException Class**:
    
    - This class extends `Exception` and includes a constructor that takes the amount causing the exception.
    - It overrides the message to provide a meaningful error message and includes a getter for the amount.
2. **BankAccount Class**:
    
    - The `deposit` method increases the balance.
    - The `withdraw` method checks if the withdrawal amount exceeds the balance. If it does, it throws an `InsufficientFundsException`.
3. **BankApp Class**:
    
    - This class creates an instance of `BankAccount` and attempts a withdrawal.
    - The withdrawal exceeds the balance, triggering the custom exception which is caught and handled in the catch block.

This example demonstrates how to create and use a custom exception to handle a specific error condition in a meaningful way, making your code more readable and maintainable.
