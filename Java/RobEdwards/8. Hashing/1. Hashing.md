$$ Problem with Linked List, if we have to find any element it will take O(n) time 

Find contains O(n)

---------------------------------------
We can change the complexity
add()
remove()
lookup()|find()
change()
------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------
O(n)
We can't change the complexity
get all entries()
get all keys()
get all values()
-------------------------------------

---------------------------------
O(1)
We can't change the complexity
size()         
isEmpty()      
isFull()       
loadFactor()   
--------------------------------


Hashing in Java is a technique for mapping data to a secret key that can be used as a unique identifier for data. It employs a function that generates those keys from the data; this function is known as the **Hash-function**, and the output of this function (keys) is known as **Hash-values**. To provide quick access to the data, we store it as key(Hash values) value(real data) pairs in an array called Hash-table, which uses keys as indexes and values to store data at each index location.
