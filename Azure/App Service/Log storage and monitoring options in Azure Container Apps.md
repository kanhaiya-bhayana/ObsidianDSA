Container Apps application logs consist of two different categories:

- Container console output (`stdout`/`stderr`) messages.
- System logs generated by Azure Container Apps.
- Spring App console logs.

You can choose between these logs destinations:

- **Log Analytics**: Azure Monitor Log Analytics is the default storage and viewing option. Your logs are stored in a Log Analytics workspace where they can be viewed and analyzed using Log Analytics queries. To learn more about Log Analytics, see [Azure Monitor Log Analytics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/log-monitoring).
- **Azure Monitor**: Azure Monitor routes logs to one or more destinations:
    - Log Analytics workspace for viewing and analysis.
    - Azure storage account to archive.
    - Azure event hub for data ingestion and analytic services. For more information, see [Azure Event Hubs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-about).
    - An Azure partner monitoring solution such as, Datadog, Elastic, Logz.io and others. For more information, see [Partner solutions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/partner-solutions/overview).
- **None**: You can disable the storage of log data. When disabled, you can still view real-time container logs via the **Logs stream** feature in your container app. For more information, see [Log streaming](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/log-streaming).

When _None_ or the _Azure Monitor_ destination is selected, the **Logs** menu item providing the Log Analytics query editor in the Azure portal is disabled.
