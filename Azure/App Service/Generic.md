To monitor logs natively for an Azure App Service running a container, you can use several built-in tools and features provided by Azure. Here are the steps to set up and access these monitoring tools:

### 1. **Enable App Service Logs**

You can enable logging for your App Service through the Azure portal:

1. **Navigate to your App Service**:
    
    - Go to the Azure portal.
    - Select your App Service.
2. **Configure App Service logs**:
    
    - In the left-hand menu, select **App Service logs**.
    - Enable **Application Logging (Filesystem)** for real-time logs.
    - Optionally, you can also enable **Web server logging** to capture detailed HTTP request and error logs.

### 2. **View Logs in Log Stream**

Once logging is enabled, you can view the logs in real-time:

1. **Navigate to the Log Stream**:
    - In the left-hand menu of your App Service, select **Log stream**.
    - This will display the live logs from your application.

### 3. **Use Azure Monitor and Application Insights**

Azure Monitor and Application Insights provide comprehensive monitoring and analytics capabilities:

1. **Enable Application Insights**:
    
    - In the Azure portal, go to your App Service.
    - In the left-hand menu, select **Application Insights**.
    - Follow the prompts to enable Application Insights for your App Service.
2. **Configure Logging and Telemetry**:
    
    - Application Insights automatically collects log and performance data from your application.
    - You can configure additional telemetry and custom logging as needed.
3. **Analyze Logs and Metrics**:
    
    - Go to the **Application Insights** resource in the Azure portal.
    - Use the **Logs** (Kusto Query Language) to query and analyze your logs.
    - Use **Metrics** to view performance and resource usage data.

### 4. **Container Insights (for Container-specific Monitoring)**

For container-specific monitoring, you can use Azure Monitor for containers:

1. **Enable Container Insights**:
    
    - In the Azure portal, go to **Azure Monitor**.
    - Select **Insights** and then **Containers**.
    - Follow the steps to enable monitoring for your container.
2. **View Container Logs and Metrics**:
    
    - After enabling Container Insights, you can view logs and metrics specific to your container.
    - Use the **Logs** and **Metrics** sections to access detailed information.

### Summary

To natively monitor logs for an Azure App Service running a container, you can:

- Enable and access logs directly through the App Service logs and Log Stream.
- Use Azure Monitor and Application Insights for more advanced monitoring and analytics.
- Utilize Container Insights for container-specific monitoring.

These tools provide a comprehensive and native solution for monitoring your application's logs and performance on Azure.

Apart from Application Insights, there are other effective native ways to monitor logs and performance for your Azure App Service running a container. Here are some alternative methods:

### 1. **Azure Monitor**

Azure Monitor is a comprehensive service for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry from your cloud and on-premises environments. Hereâ€™s how you can use it:

#### **Log Analytics Workspace**

1. **Create a Log Analytics Workspace**:
    
    - Navigate to **Azure Monitor** in the Azure portal.
    - Select **Log Analytics workspaces** and create a new workspace.
2. **Link Log Analytics Workspace to Your App Service**:
    
    - Go to your App Service.
    - In the left-hand menu, select **Diagnostics settings**.
    - Add a new diagnostic setting and choose **Send to Log Analytics workspace**.
    - Select the workspace you created.
3. **Query Logs**:
    
    - Use the Log Analytics workspace to write queries using Kusto Query Language (KQL) to analyze your logs.
    - Navigate to the Log Analytics workspace and select **Logs** to start querying.

#### **Azure Monitor Metrics**

1. **Access Metrics**:
    - Navigate to your App Service.
    - In the left-hand menu, select **Metrics**.
    - Here you can view and analyze metrics related to your App Service such as CPU usage, memory usage, and more.

### 2. **Azure Storage Account for Log Storage**

You can configure your App Service to store logs in an Azure Storage Account for later analysis:

1. **Create a Storage Account**:
    
    - Go to the Azure portal and create a new Storage Account.
2. **Configure App Service to Save Logs to Storage Account**:
    
    - Navigate to your App Service.
    - Select **App Service logs** from the left-hand menu.
    - Enable **Web server logging** and choose **Storage**.
    - Configure the storage account and retention period.
3. **Access Logs**:
    
    - Navigate to your Storage Account.
    - Go to **Blobs** and locate the container where logs are stored.
    - Download and analyze the logs as needed.

### 3. **Azure Log Stream**

Azure Log Stream provides real-time logging for your App Service:

1. **Enable Logging**:
    
    - Ensure that **Application Logging (Filesystem)** is enabled in the App Service logs settings.
2. **Access Log Stream**:
    
    - In the left-hand menu of your App Service, select **Log stream**.
    - This will show real-time logs from your application.

### 4. **Azure Event Hubs**

For more advanced scenarios, you can stream logs to Azure Event Hubs and use other tools for further analysis:

1. **Create an Event Hub**:
    
    - Go to the Azure portal and create a new Event Hub.
2. **Configure Diagnostics Settings**:
    
    - Go to your App Service.
    - Select **Diagnostics settings**.
    - Add a new diagnostic setting and choose **Stream to an event hub**.
3. **Stream and Analyze Logs**:
    
    - Stream logs to the Event Hub and use tools like Azure Stream Analytics or third-party solutions to process and analyze the logs.

### Summary

The best alternatives to Application Insights for monitoring your Azure App Service running a container include:

- **Azure Monitor** with Log Analytics Workspace and Metrics.
- **Azure Storage Account** for storing and accessing logs.
- **Azure Log Stream** for real-time logging.
- **Azure Event Hubs** for streaming and advanced log processing.

Each of these methods provides robust capabilities for logging and monitoring, allowing you to choose the one that best fits your needs and existing workflows.
