scenarios requiring a userâ€™s input or decision at specific stages before progressing further. 
Unlike fully automated workflows, the Human Interaction Pattern includes built-in pauses, allowing for processes that involve approval or validation by a person. This pattern is essential in applications where certain steps can't be automated end-to-end, requiring human intervention for tasks like approving a leave request, verifying identity, or authorizing expense reports.

### Key Components of the Human Interaction Pattern

1. **External Events**: The function waits for a signal from an external source to proceed. 
2. **Timers**: These manage timeouts in case the human response is delayed or missing. If a timer expires, it allows the function to proceed with a default action or fail gracefully.
3. **Orchestration**: Durable Functions orchestrate the entire workflow, keeping track of state and ensuring the process resumes correctly after each input or timeout.
