Azure Durable Functions are an extension of Azure Functions that allow you to write stateful, long-running workflows in a serverless compute environment. They enable complex orchestration patterns by managing the state, checkpoints, and restarts of the workflows for you. This makes it easier to handle scenarios that involve long-running processes, human interactions, or external system interactions.

### Key Concepts

1. **Durable Function Orchestrator**    
    - **Definition:** The orchestrator function defines the workflow of your application. It can call other functions (known as activity functions) and manage their execution.
    - **Characteristics:** It is stateless and durable. It handles the state and manages checkpoints automatically, ensuring that the workflow can be resumed or restarted if needed.

1. **Durable Activity Function**   
    - **Definition:** These functions perform the actual work in the workflow. They are called by the orchestrator function and can be executed in parallel or sequentially.
    - **Characteristics:** They are stateless and perform individual tasks within the workflow.

2. **Durable Entities**
    - **Definition:** Durable Entities represent stateful objects and are used for managing state in a way that is more complex than what can be achieved with activity functions alone. They can be used to build applications like shopping carts or user sessions.
    - **Characteristics:** They provide a way to manage and interact with state over time and can be used to implement stateful, reliable systems.

1. **Durable Timers**    
    - **Definition:** These are used to pause the execution of an orchestration for a specific period or until a specific time. This is useful for implementing delay or retry logic.
    - **Characteristics:** They allow you to schedule future activities or delays without blocking the execution of other parts of the orchestration.


### Example Scenario

Letâ€™s create a simple example where Azure Durable Functions are used to orchestrate a multi-step workflow for processing an order. The workflow will include steps such as validating the order, charging the customer, and sending a confirmation email.
