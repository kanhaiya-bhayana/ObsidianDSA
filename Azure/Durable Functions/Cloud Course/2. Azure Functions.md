- An Azure Function is a serverless compute service offered by Microsoft Azure. It allows you to run small pieces of code, or "functions," in the cloud without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. This means you can focus on writing the code that performs your desired tasks while Azure handles scaling, patching, and infrastructure management.
- Run code on demand
- No management of underlying infrastructure
- Azure Functions uses event driven programming model.
###### Example Scenario - Blob Trigger
Let’s say you want to create an Azure Function that interacts with Azure Blob Storage. Specifically, you want to create a function that triggers whenever a new file is uploaded to a specific container in Azure Blob Storage and then processes the file in some way (e.g., logs its name or analyzes its content).

###### Example Scenario - Timer Trigger
Let’s say you want to create an Azure Function that runs every day at midnight to clean up old records from a database. You can use a Timer Trigger to accomplish this.

###### Example Scenario - Queue Trigger
An Azure Queue Trigger activates the function whenever a new message is added to an Azure Storage Queue. This means your function can automatically start processing a message as soon as it appears in the queue. This is a common pattern for background processing, task queuing, and handling asynchronous workloads.
###### Example: Processing New Messages in a Queue
Let's walk through a more detailed example where an Azure Function is triggered by new messages pushed into a queue.

###### Scenario
Imagine you have a queue that receives messages about new user sign-ups. Each message contains user details that need to be processed, such as sending a welcome email.
### Key Features:
- **Serverless:** You don’t need to worry about managing servers or infrastructure.
- **Event-Driven:** Functions can be triggered by various events, such as HTTP requests, timer schedules, or messages from queues.
- **Scalability:** Azure Functions automatically scales to handle the load of your function calls.
- **Cost-Effective:** You only pay for the time your code is running.


### Trigger
In Azure Functions, a "trigger" is the mechanism that starts the execution of a function. Triggers define how and when a function should be invoked, based on specific events or schedules. Essentially, a trigger is responsible for invoking your function code in response to an event.

### Types of Triggers
Azure Functions supports several types of triggers, each suited for different scenarios. Here’s an overview of some common triggers:

1. **HTTP Trigger**    
    - **Description:** Invokes the function in response to HTTP requests.
    - **Use Case:** Building APIs or webhooks where functions execute in response to incoming HTTP requests.
    - **Example:** An endpoint that processes form submissions or handles API requests.

1. **Timer Trigger**
    - **Description:** Executes the function based on a schedule, using CRON expressions.
    - **Use Case:** Performing periodic tasks such as running scheduled reports, clean-up jobs, or data backups.
    - **Example:** A function that runs every night at midnight to archive old records.

1. **Blob Trigger**
    - **Description:** Activates the function when a new blob (file) is added or updated in Azure Blob Storage.
    - **Use Case:** Processing files such as images, documents, or logs when they are uploaded to a storage container.
    - **Example:** Automatically resizing images or analyzing log files upon upload.

1. **Queue Trigger**
    - **Description:** Triggers the function when a new message is added to an Azure Storage Queue.
    - **Use Case:** Handling background tasks, processing messages or data in a queue.
    - **Example:** Processing orders from an e-commerce site where each order is queued for further processing.

1. **Service Bus Trigger**
    - **Description:** Initiates the function when a new message arrives in an Azure Service Bus Queue or Topic.
    - **Use Case:** Integrating with messaging systems for complex workflows or distributed applications.
    - **Example:** Processing messages from a Service Bus topic for real-time analytics.

1. **Event Grid Trigger**
    - **Description:** Responds to events published by Azure Event Grid.
    - **Use Case:** Building event-driven architectures where functions react to various events across Azure services.
    - **Example:** Reacting to resource changes or custom events in an event-driven system.

1. **Event Hub Trigger**
    - **Description:** Executes the function when new events are sent to an Azure Event Hub.
    - **Use Case:** Processing large streams of data from event sources like telemetry data or logs.
    - **Example:** Analyzing streaming data from IoT devices.

1. **Cosmos DB Trigger**
    - **Description:** Triggers the function when documents in a Cosmos DB collection are created or modified.
    - **Use Case:** Reacting to changes in a NoSQL database for real-time data processing.
    - **Example:** Updating a cache or triggering notifications based on changes in a database.

### How Triggers Work
1. **Event Detection:** The trigger monitors a specific event or condition (e.g., an HTTP request, a new blob in storage, or a scheduled time).
2. **Function Invocation:** When the trigger detects the event, it invokes the associated function.
3. **Execution:** The function runs, processing the data or performing the actions defined in the function code.

### Bindings
- Declarative way of connecting services/resources with azure functions.

In Azure Functions, **bindings** are a way to declaratively connect your function to various data sources or services, without having to write custom code to handle the connections and data manipulation. They simplify the process of integrating with different services and data sources, allowing you to focus on the business logic of your function.

###### Types of Bindings
***Bindings can be categorized into input bindings and output bindings:***
- **Input Bindings:** Provide data to your function. For example, an input binding might provide a message from an Azure Queue or data from an Azure Cosmos DB.
- **Output Bindings:** Send data from your function to a service or data source. For example, an output binding might write data to an Azure Blob Storage or an Azure SQL Database.

###### How Bindings Work
Bindings are defined in the `function.json` file of your function app. This JSON configuration specifies the binding type, direction (input or output), and any necessary configuration settings.
