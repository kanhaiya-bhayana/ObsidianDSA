#### Interceptors

Entity Framework Core interceptors are a feature introduced in EF Core 6.0 that allow you to intercept, modify, or augment database operations before or after they occur. They provide a way to implement cross-cutting concerns like auditing, logging, or data manipulation consistently across your application.
### How EF Core Interceptors Work

EF Core interceptors implement one or more interfaces from the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Diagnostics` namespace. The primary interfaces include:

1. **`IDbCommandInterceptor`**  
    Used to intercept and modify the behavior of database commands (e.g., SQL queries and commands executed by EF Core).
    
2. **`ISaveChangesInterceptor`**  
    Used to intercept `SaveChanges` or `SaveChangesAsync` calls, allowing actions such as auditing or validation during save operations.
    
3. **`ITransactionInterceptor`**  
    Used to intercept operations involving transactions, such as beginning, committing, or rolling back a transaction.
    
4. **`IConnectionInterceptor`**  
    Used to intercept operations related to database connections, such as opening or closing connections.
    
5. **`IQueryInterceptor`**  
    Allows interception of LINQ queries before they are translated to SQL.
    
6. **`IInterceptor` (Base Interface)**  
    All interceptors derive from this base interface.


###### Here are the main types of interceptors:

```csharp
// SaveChanges Interceptor
public class AuditInterceptor : SaveChangesInterceptor
{
    public override ValueTask<InterceptionResult<int>> SavingChangesAsync(
        DbContextEventData eventData,
        InterceptionResult<int> result,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        var entries = eventData.Context.ChangeTracker
            .Entries()
            .Where(e => e.State == EntityState.Added || e.State == EntityState.Modified);
            
        foreach (var entry in entries)
        {
            if (entry.Entity is IAuditable auditable)
            {
                auditable.LastModified = DateTime.UtcNow;
                if (entry.State == EntityState.Added)
                {
                    auditable.CreatedAt = DateTime.UtcNow;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return base.SavingChangesAsync(eventData, result, cancellationToken);
    }
}

// Connection Interceptor
public class ConnectionInterceptor : DbConnectionInterceptor
{
    public override InterceptionResult ConnectionOpening(
        DbConnection connection,
        ConnectionEventData eventData,
        InterceptionResult result)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Opening connection to {connection.ConnectionString}");
        return result;
    }
}

// Command Interceptor
public class CommandInterceptor : DbCommandInterceptor
{
    public override InterceptionResult<DbDataReader> ReaderExecuting(
        DbCommand command,
        CommandEventData eventData,
        InterceptionResult<DbDataReader> result)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Executing SQL: {command.CommandText}");
        return result;
    }
}
```

###### The main types of interceptors are:

1. SaveChanges Interceptors: Intercept operations during SaveChanges/SaveChangesAsync
   - Useful for implementing audit trails, validation, or automatic property updates

2. Connection Interceptors: Intercept database connection operations
   - Good for connection logging, monitoring, or manipulation

3. Command Interceptors: Intercept database commands
   - Perfect for SQL logging, query modification, or performance monitoring

4. Transaction Interceptors: Intercept transaction-related operations
   - Helpful for transaction logging or custom transaction handling

To register an interceptor, you add it in your DbContext configuration:

```csharp
protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
{
    optionsBuilder
        .UseSqlServer(connectionString)
        .AddInterceptors(new AuditInterceptor())
        .AddInterceptors(new ConnectionInterceptor());
}
```

You can also register interceptors through dependency injection:

```csharp
services.AddDbContext<YourDbContext>(options =>
{
    options
        .UseSqlServer(connectionString)
        .AddInterceptors(
            new AuditInterceptor(),
            new ConnectionInterceptor()
        );
});
```

Key benefits of using interceptors:
- Separation of concerns
- Consistent cross-cutting functionality
- Clean way to implement audit trails
- Centralized logging and monitoring
- Ability to modify or enhance EF Core's behavior without changing business logic
